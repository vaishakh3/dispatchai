What's your address, ma'am?
Hello?
What's your address, ma'am?
It's 318 McCrae Street.
He's been stabbed really bad.
Okay.
Is he breathing, ma'am?
Not the wrong.
Sit down.
Ma'am.
She has blood coming everywhere.
Okay.
The person who stabbed him, is he there?
No.
No, I, I, I, I, I didn't want to take a deep breath, okay?
I don't know what I was in a hospital, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, how old is he?
I can't get into six down, and the more he was a brown.
What's your name, what's your name, ma'am?
Just take a deep breath, okay, it's here.
Lay down! Lay down!
Yes, it needs a leg down.
You can be breathing.
Yes.
With a worry.
Oh, my God!
Ma'am!
What's going on?
Ma'am.
He just ran into the tent.
He just ran into the stairs.
And that's not going to go.
Ma'am.
Ma'am.
Please, I need to get in the hospital.
Ma'am.
Ma'am.
Ma'am, is he breathing?
Maryle, is the bleeding serious?
Ma'am.
I need to kill him if I can hold him now.
Ma'am?
I need you to answer these questions so we need your help on the way.
Is he completely alert?
Where would be injured at, ma'am?
In his stomach.
I'm going to show much blood.
I can't tell where it's all coming from.
Okay.
Is there more than one?
Ma'am, I need you to answer the question so we can get on there as fast as we can.
Is there more than one womb?
I'm not only seeing one wound.
Just take a little wound.
Just take a deep breath.
Okay. I'm sitting as a paramedist now. Stand-alone. I'll tell you exactly what to do that.
If there's anything penetrating, do not pull it out, okay?
I'm not. I'm certified. I know that this is okay, but I'm sort of trying to start
CPR first aid. If I need to wrap anything up, if there's anything that is
hurting out. Right. Do not pull it out.
He hit his head against him tears, so I don't want to move him.
Okay. That's right. Don't move.
But just keep listening, okay?
Rest you're him to help us on the way.
Don't let him have anything to eat or drink.
It may make him sick or cause problems for the doctor, okay?
Do you know where the person is who stabbed him?
Is there anything I can do?
Do you know where the person is who stabbed him, ma'am?
Ma'am.
Is there somebody else there with you besides him?
I'm a roommate.
Okay.
Well, tell them to go get a clean dry cloth, okay?
He's gone.
He's gone, but he's shut away.
I don't plan.
Ma'am, ma'am.
I had no one that's got him right.
Ma'am.
Listen to me.
Go get a clean dry cloth, okay?
Let me take a second.
Ma'am.
He's got to wake up.
What is he doing now, ma'am?
His eyes are dilated.
Just try to keep them awake.
I need you to get a clean, dry cloth, okay?
Okay.
We need to try to stop the bleeding.
I want to make sure you hear me.
Can you hear me?
In the stomach.
Ma'am.
I need you to get a clean dry cloth so we can try to stop the bleeding
until the paramedics get there.
Okay.

Can I tie it down tight?
Yes, ma'am.
Don't tie it.
Just press it down firmly.
Okay.
Did it happen inside the house?
Yeah.
It happened inside the house?
I had a young 18-year-old roommate in the house,
and my fiancé was out of town.
I thought it was helping pay the bills.
He came back and I guess I guess I've read more of a sheltered life than my ex had.
Ma'am, I understand that and I'll get to your story later, but which one is the person that's cut?
Your roommate or your ex that came back?
My fiancé.
Your fiancé is the one that's cut?
Yes.
Okay, if he's still alert?
If he's still alert?
