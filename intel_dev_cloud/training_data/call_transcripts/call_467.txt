It's all that one else, sir.
Put your phone in your ear.
Okay, I need a use.
I'm going to stop.

Ma'am.
I lost her.
She's in a lake.
I'm talking about the road.
She said she's in a lake.
Yeah, she says she's in a lake.
Yes, she says through the fairway at Batesville.
Here's a county public safety.
Hey, it's Alpharetta.
Hey.
We have a female.
She calls 911 possible drowning.
She says she's in a lake.
She's giving me 30188 Batesville at the fairway.
3.0188 is, is that a zip code?
I'm not sure.
She was in distress.
I wasn't sure she was giving a straight.
She said the fairways.
That's the main information she was trying to give me.
And then we lost contact.
We have the fairway at Batesville.
What did she say?
Is there a lake in there?
She said she's in a lake.
Did it in a vehicle or?
I lost contact.
I was trying to get that location.
And what agency with?
Alpharetta.
We have a unit in route to check our local lakes.
She just said she was in the lake.
Yeah, she said she's in the lake.
She's losing air fast.
I lost contact where I'm unable to be established contact.
I'm guessing her car went in the lake, yeah.
Now, the fairway where is that?
It's directly off the bait still.
I'm not sure if that's a street name.
It's a street name called the Fairway.
It looks like it could be a neighborhood called the Fairway.
but that's actually a street name. It's right off a Batesville.
Do you know if there's a lake fair?
I'm not, let me ask this.
Cherokee saying they may have a fairway on Batesville.
Is fire familiar with anything?
We're asking our units in that area if they're familiar with a lake.
Okay.
That's going to be here.
Yeah, that intersection is that we're asking for me with a lake.
Yeah, they're advising.
I have their key on the line.
Who is that truck warrant?
They said that there's a pond by the Greenway, so there's a pond right in the area.
Okay.
Okay, I need you to call me back on that after you guys check.
I have a unit on the way, though.
I have a police on the way to try to locate in our city too, okay?
We've got our young pen on the way as well.
I'll listen to this and that.
Thank you.
You are.
