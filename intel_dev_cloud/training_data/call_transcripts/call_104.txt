No, because my brother and I were downstairs, and I just heard people yelling and screaming upstairs.

I'm guessing they were gone because my brother is trying to help myself.
So you told your brother to go upstairs and help when you heard screaming?

And I said, go help, go help, because they were screaming.
My brother ran upstairs.

You told me I needed to talk to you.
Okay, he handed the phone and you saw him covered in blood, okay.
Now, what you're saying is that your brother was downstairs with you the whole time until you made him go upstairs?
I heard loud, loud footsteps and then I yelled to my dad screaming, and then I yelled to my brother because I was on one side of the
