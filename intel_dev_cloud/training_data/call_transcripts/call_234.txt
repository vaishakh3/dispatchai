You see black eyes, you said?
You see black eyes running down the street?
You said you see black eyes running down Macy, away from University Boulevard where Macy, right there, Macy and University where Popeye's chicken is, they're running down Macy towards, I don't know what that next road is down there.
I can't think right now.
Okay.
And how many of them did you see run off?
Three.
Three of them.
Could you tell what they had on?

and two more people take off between the building down here, running down on the corner of Mar-Chack and Commerce,
running down towards, away from University.
Mar-Chack and Commerce?
Yeah, and there were a couple of them.
I could see two of them.
They had on light-colored clothes, like white T-shirts.
Were they going to hear of them?
I couldn't see their skin.
I could just see the white clothes, and then I could see the black boys over here on this corner,
but I couldn't see what they were wearing.
But they were scattering big time.
And they ran down bar check.
Yeah, and it sounded like two or three different guns going off.
I mean, from the sound of them.
It sounded like maybe a 22 and a great big gun and maybe one more.
And were they running towards Commerce from University?
Well, Commerce runs down across University.
I can't think of the name of that next street down here.
But they had come off of university, right?

All of them came off the university,
and two of them took off down Macy
and two of them took off down commerce.
