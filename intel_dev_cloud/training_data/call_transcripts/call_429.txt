Yeah, my daughter or not breathe.
Okay, what's the address?

Okay, what's the street?
What's the street?
Carson now.
I'm just going to ask a few more questions so I can tell you what to do,
but these questions are going to help me to help you.
Are you with her right now?
Yes, I'm holding her my head.
How old is she?
She's two months.
She's two months.
Is she awake?
No, she ain't away.
But is she conscious? Can you wake her up?
I'm trying to wake her.
I'm shaking.
Don't shake her.
Is she breathing?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I'm giving the sword to my dispatcher.
Don't hang up, okay?
Oh.
We got help on the way for her, okay?
And you said you don't think she's breathing?
No, but she ain't turning no color though.
Okay.
And you're right there with her?
Yeah.
Listen carefully.
You need to lay the baby flat on her back on the floor and remove any pillows, okay?
All right.
Let me know when you've done that.
Kneel next to her and look.
in her mouth for food or vomit.
Is there anything in her mouth?
No.
Okay, you need to place your hand on the baby's forehead and your other hand under her neck and shoulders and slightly tilt the head back.
Can you repeat that?
Place your hand on her forehead and your other hand under her neck and shoulders and slightly
tilt her head back, like she's looking straight up towards the ceiling and put your ear next
to her mouth.
Put your ear next to her mouth. Put your ear next to her mouth.
Can you feel or hear any breathing?
You can hear her breathing?
You can hear her breathing?
Is she breathing normally?
No.
Okay.
I want you to look at her closely.
Tell me every time she takes a breath, okay?
When you see her, take a breath, say now.
When you see her, take a breath, say now.
Okay, she has she taken one?
I don't think so.
It looks like it.
Okay, well, we're going to have to start CPR on her.
I'm going to tell you how to give mouth to mouth.
Okay?
With the baby's head slightly tilted back, completely cover her mouth and nose with your mouth,
and blow two puffs of air into her lungs about one second each, just enough to make the chest rise with each breath, okay?
All right.
Did you feel the air going in and out?
I'm sorry, one time.
You got to do it two puffs, two puffs of air into the lungs, about one second each.
Just enough to make the chest rise.
Did you feel?
air going in and out.
You're out there. Air going and...
Okay, now listen carefully. I'm going to tell you how to do chest compressions.
Make sure the baby's flat on her back on the ground and place two fingers on the breastbone
right between the nipples.
Okay?
You say what?
Place two fingers on the breastbone right in the center of the chest between the nipples, okay?
Now you need to push down an inch and a half with only your fingers touching the chest.
Pump the chest, hard and fast, 30 times at least twice per second, but you have to let the chest
come all the way up between pumps, okay?
All right.
30 times.
Tell me when you're done.
All right.
You need to go, just, one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four.
Tell me when you've done 30.
Count out loud.
Four.
One, two, three, four.
Tell me when you count to 30.
When you've done 30, let me know.
One, two, three, four.
Have your wife, whoever's in there.
I'll lock the door, because they're coming.
I lock the door, dude.
Tell me when you've done 30.
30 pumps.
Two, here.
You need to do it 30 times.
Keep going, tell me when you've done 30.
Have you done 30?
Have you done 30?
No, not that.
I'm close.
One, two, three, one, two, three, like that.
But you've got to count 30 of them.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, like that.
Okay, have you done 30?
Yes.
Okay.
Now with your hand on your neck and shoulders,
you need to tilt her head back and put your mouth over her nose again
and give her two more puffs, okay?
Two more puffs of breath.
And then pump the chest 30 more times, all right?
You say what?
After you've done the 30 pumps, or you give her two more puffs of breath, okay?
Blow two more puffs of breath into her mouth and nose.
With your hand under her neck and shoulders,
tilts her head back again, and put your mouth over her nose and mouth
and give her two more puffs.
And then pump her chest 30 more times.
Let me know when you've done that.
Make sure your fingers are on the breastbone right between the nipples.
Did you give her the two pups?
Yeah.
Now, are you doing the 30 pumps on the chest?
Yeah.
Okay, let me know when you're done with that, okay?
Count out loud to make sure you're doing it, quick enough.
Don't she's not dead, Joe.
