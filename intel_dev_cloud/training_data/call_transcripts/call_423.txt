The time, 0.353.
911, you need police, fire, medical.
I need medical.
Okay, where are you?
Okay, I'm in UCF, Lake Claire, building 57, third floor, room 3,11.
My friend was drinking, and she woke me up, and she's sick,
and now she's not responding.
Her eyes were just open, now they're closed.
She's really trying to see you know this morning.
Ma'am, hold on one second.
I'm going to transfer over to the side department.
Do not hang up, okay?
Okay.
Yeah, building.
Yeah, building 57.
Yeah, it's going to be here on campus, meaning UCF.
Mm-hmm.
It's building with a transfer.
Okay, there's two people talking at the same time.
The address is 4,000 Central Florida Boulevard.
Correct.
Let me give her the address real quick.
It's going to be, yes, 4,000 Central Florida Boulevard is the address for the campus.
It's going to be Lake Claire Apartments, Building 57-57, and it's going to be room 311.
Okay, building 57, room 311?
Correct, 311.
Okay, and I'm sorry, you said Lake Claire apartments?
Yeah, the Lake Claire community here on campus.
Lake Claire community.
Mm-hmm.
Okay.
It's the email that you have on the line.
Her roommate was drinking, and she said her eyes rolled in the back of her head, and she's not responding.
Okay.
No, I mean, she's like, she's, I don't know what to do.
She's purple.
She's going back.
She's gasping for air.
Does she have a history of seizures or anything?
I don't know, but she's purple.
She's really clamy.
She told me her heart hurt.
All right.
All right, listen to me.
What you need to do is you need to get her laying down flat, all right?
Take any pillows or anything out from underneath her head.
Lay her down flat.
Okay.
And then I want you to get your hand, put one hand on her forehead, one hand under her neck, and tilt her head back.
Okay.
And see if that helps with her breathing.
Now, how old is she?
No, she's unconscious now.
Okay, listen.
How old is she?
She's not breathing.
She's 18 years old.
Okay.
I want you to put your head down close to her face.
Okay.
Put your ear up close to her mouth and look at her chest
see if you hear or feel any breathing.
I don't hear or feel anything.
You don't see her chest rise?
No, she's not breathing.
Okay, listen.
All right, well, then we need to help her, okay?
Are you going to be able to help her do some thin of yarn until they get there?
Yep.
All right.
What I want you to do is with your hands, keep her head tilted back,
pinch her nose shut, put your mouth over her mouth,
and give her two breaths of air.
Okay.
Did you see her chest rise with those?
I didn't know.
Okay.
What I want you to do then is readjust her head.
Okay.
One hand on her forehead, one hand under her neck.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Give her two breaths of air.
Okay.
Okay, it rose.
Did you see her chest go up that time?
Yeah, I did.
Okay, now is she still breathing now?
No, she's not.
Okay, now what I want you to do then is I want you to put your hand, one of your hands,
right in the middle of her chest, right between the nipples, okay?
Okay, right on the left bone.
Okay, she just took her gas of air.
Okay, what I want you to do is put the other.
hand on top of that hand. She took a gasp of air?
Yes, she's every couple of seconds. Is she responsive to you at all?
No, Anne. No, not at all.
Okay. What we're going to do then is we're going to go ahead and start compressions.
I put my... Pushed down firmly, about two inches.
She's on her bed. It's so hard. Are you able to get her down to the floor?
No.
Okay, well, we're going to do the best we can with her on the bed, okay?
Okay.
Okay, I'm doing it.
All right with the heel of your low hand, put your hand right in the middle of a breastbone,
right between her nipples.
I did it twice.
I did it twice.
Okay.
Now what you're going to do is we're going to do CPR.
We're going to pump hard and fast at least twice per second.
Twice per second?
Uh-huh.
And we're going to do this 600 times or until help can take over.
Okay.
Okay.
Let the chest come up all the way between pumps and count out loud so I can count with you.
One, two, three, and four, and five, and six.
and seven. Okay, that's what we need to do. Okay, she's going. All right, well, then we need to stop.
If she's breathing, you need to stop. Well, I don't feel a pulse. Okay, yeah, I barely feel a pulse at all.
But every couple seconds, she's still gasping for air? Yeah, I can hear an ambulance. Should I go open up the door?
Yes, you need to open the door. Okay. Okay. I just heard the noise.
but I didn't see anybody.
Hi.
Okay, thank you so much.
Are they in there with you now?
Yep.
Thank you.
Okay, all right.
Bye-bye.
Okay, bye-bye.
