Well, they were outside plane, and I was on the porch, watching them plane, and they just disappeared.
I looked up for them and it wasn't killed.

Why did you just decide to call a?
now? Well, I thought it was with a friend, and I was waiting for the friend to come home,
and when I called, when I looked, she wasn't there, so I called her on her cell phone,
which I got her cell phone number from her neighbor, and she said that she had been gone
since earlier this morning, and she had not seen my son this morning. I've been looking
for him, which is why I didn't call y'all, because I've been walking around looking and waiting.
