Hey Amelia, this is Todd. How you doing?
Hey, Todd, what's up?
Hey, Todd, what's up?
Hey, can you send someone by Hawkins that runs between Lynn and Post,
over in Zone 2?
What's up?
It's going to reference possible shots fired and some type of disturbance.
What?
Oh, Lord, where's Megan?
She's quiet tonight.
We've got her crowd.
I'm just saying.
How many shots?
Like three or four.
All right, and you know it since it's Thanksgiving, I'll even let you be anonymous.
All right, there you go.
It's over my folks' house, so don't make the contact because there's some more than questionable people living behind them now.
So if you can just leave it anonymous, that's fine.
No problem.
Thank you.
Have a happy Thanksgiving.
You too. Talk to later.
All right, bye.
