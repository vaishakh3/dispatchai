and I thought the gentleman was backing out,
and I went back to my house, but he never backed out,
and I came back over, and his driver's side window is shattered,
and he's battered and can't answer.
He's inside.
I don't know if somebody tried to shoot him or if he shot himself or what.
I don't know.
And was that at this location, correct?
He didn't send an ambulance in a hurry, an EMT.
He's still alive.
He's moving.

Yes, sir.
They're already on the way, okay?
Are you with him now?
I'm standing right outside the garage door.
Can you tell me how old he is?
I don't know.
