Hi.
Hi, I look at 16 Fayette Road, and all this, I'm, like, sleeping, and all of a sudden I heard a huge, like, huge gome.
Okay.
And I look out my window, and the house across the street right behind it, which is a base.
It looked like the atomic bomb went off, and it was a mushroom cloud, and fire was going everywhere, and I don't, you know anything about this?
Okay, we have had several calls on it.
We do have units heading in that direction.
We don't know exactly what it is just yet.
Okay.
Do I need to, it's close to my house.
This is fire.
Like, I don't know if it's in the police, should I, like...
We have police and fire, both in row.
We're going to try and get in touch with the base right now, okay?
Oh, and then we just stay tight over it.
Okay.
What would that, ma'am?
I can't hear you.
Should we, like, get out of here, or I don't know?
I can't make that call right now, ma'am, because I don't know what's going on.
Okay.
Okay.
Should I call back later?
If you're on 2145, if you want to give us a call back later, absolutely.
When you'll have more information then, okay?
Oh, thank you.
All right.
Bye-bye.
