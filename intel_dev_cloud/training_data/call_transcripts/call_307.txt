Okay.
Is he breathing at all?
I can't tell.
How can I tell?
Okay.
If he's getting any there at all, can you be able to hear it or see his chest rise and fall?
Do you know what he's choking on?
I have no idea.
No idea?
No idea?
Okay.
Oh, my gosh.
Please help me.
Okay, okay.
Look, I don't, I don't want you to slap him on the back, okay?
I'm getting an ambulance head in your way.
Okay.
It's how we see it can do in the meantime.
Yes.
You're by him right now?

Okay.
Oh, my heart.
Okay.
Tell me exactly what you see and hear him doing.
He's like here in either part open.

He's just like limp.
Okay.
Okay, is he face up on the ground?
Huh?
Do you have him, lay him face up on the ground?
Face up.
Uh-huh.
And I want you to place two fingers in the center of his chest, right between his nipples.
Okay?
In his nipples?
Okay, and push down quickly, one inch with only your fingers touching his chest.
Yeah, because he has a little bit of reaction.
He does?
Okay.
Is he, keep doing it until he starts to breathe or cry, or cry?
Okay, just keep doing it, okay. Just keep doing it, okay? Don't give up. Just keep doing it.
Keep doing it until he breathed or cried.
Just not, please. Like on his, right in between his nipples.
He's breathing a little bit.
And then he stopped. Oh, my God.
Okay. Okay, just keep doing it.
Okay, is he just flat on his mouth.
Okay.
Okay, just, is he just flat on his back, on the ground?
Oh, my heart.
What are we going to do?
Can you see anything in his mouth?
I can't see it.
I don't see anything.
We'll see any of my finger weight on his throat.
Okay.
Okay.
I can't breathe.
He took a little breath.
No, oh, my gosh.
Okay.
All right, that's a good sign, okay?
Try to stay calm.
Try to stay calm.
I don't know what it is.
It's in there.
I reach really far down.
I can't try it out.
Okay.
I don't want you to stick your fingers of his mouth
because you might force it down there further, okay?
Okay.
Okay, I just want you to put your hand on his forehead
and your other hand under his neck and shoulders.
Okay.
And slightly tilt his head back.
Okay.
Okay, put your ear next to his mouth.
Okay.
Can you feel or hear any breathing?
Very, very light.
Okay.
Just keep him like that, okay, if he's getting a little bit of air.
Okay.
You want to keep his airway open.

Yes.
Okay.
Okay, just try to stay calm for me, okay?
Okay.
Oh, my God.

Oh, my dear.
Okay.
Is he still getting some air?
Yes.
You just take breath?
Oh, my God.
Okay.
Please.
Do you feel, can you see his chest rising or anything?
Can you still feel the air?
I can leave it, like, every now and then he'll take this, like,
oh, like, breath.
Oh, my God.
Okay.
Okay.
Let me tell you how to give mouth to mouth, okay?
Okay.
Okay, with his head still slightly tilted back.
Okay.
Okay, I want you to completely cover his mouth and nose with your mouth.
Okay.
And then blow two puffs of air into his lungs, about one second each.
Just enough to make his chest rise with each breath.
Okay.
Okay, and then keep doing it?
Yes.
Do two, and then let me know if you feel the air going in and out.
He's getting like take a gas where he does it.
Okay.
