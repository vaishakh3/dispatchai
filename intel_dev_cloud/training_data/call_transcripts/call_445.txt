No, I think someone's in.
Okay, did you hear the front door?
I'm hearing noise for lights, like, the doors and the windows.
Front door locked?
Yes.
Okay, where are you right now?
In a closet.
Four deputies and a canine on the way to you, okay?
They are there, okay, but they're out front, all right?
They're looking around your house trying to find somebody, okay?
So we don't want you going out.
The police are outside?
They're checking, okay?
No.
Um, if you go down the hall, I'm the second door to the left.
Um, I'm just kind of scared to be honest.
And one of the deputies is walking around your house, trying to find a way to get in so that he can get you out.
They're inside.
Should I go out?
Hold on just a second, okay?
Just stay right there.
I let them know what bedroom you're in, okay?
Okay.
No, they just said wait right there.
If they didn't tell you to come out and don't come out.
Yeah, I'm not.
Okay, they're taking me outside.
Okay.
Do I hang up?
Okay.
Okay, thank you.
Hi, I'd like to just report an incident.
I'm in Rossmoor.
I'm cleaning my swimming pool.
and two African-American guys
come jumping over the wall
alone one second
so the first guy
he's a male black
about how old
they look like they're early 20s
units that were in the area anyways
because someone called
so this is kind of like
a secondary part of this
so we're just trying to locate them

and trying to find him right now
