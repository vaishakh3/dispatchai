Okay, we're getting somebody on the way to help you, okay?
Okay.
Someone's on the way.
Are you guys floating towards the marina or are you floating back out?
We're floating back out.
We're kind of going west, well, west, but we're going west.
We're like north, almost still north of the marina, though.
but we're still getting blown to the west.
To the west?
Yeah.
But we're still pretty much north of the marina,
kind of northwest of it barely.
Okay, hang on just a second.
We're still trying to get a hold of more people
to get them out there.
We're behind Saltair to the north.
Behind the Salterra and to the north.
Saltair Marina.
There's a building.
The building where all the condes are.
We're just lost to that.
What was that you just said?
I can't feel your knees.
Not right now I can't.
He can't still can.
Alright, we've got help coming for you guys.
Okay.
Yeah, where the concert is at.
You at?
South Air Concerst which building?
You're north of which building?
Where do they hold the concert at?
Oh, where they held the concert at?
We're at about a mile from that building.
About a mile out.
A mile north of that building.
of it? You're a mile north of that building or a mile west?
Yeah, mile north of where they have a concert, Salt Air Concert.
Okay.
We do have a parking wreck guy in his boat headed out to you guys, okay?
Okay.
One of our officers from out there.
Stay on the phone with me.

We're trying to get the Latitude and Logitude off your phone.
Yeah, I can hear you.
Okay.
All right.
We're trying to get your location off your cell phone.
We do have our parks guy coming to you.
He was running out to his boat to come out there, okay?
Okay.
I can't hear you.
The wind is howling out here.
Okay.
Okay.
How are you doing?
How am I doing?
I'm freezing.
All right.
We're coming.
He's in his boat right now.
He's on the radio.
It's in his boat right now.
He's on the radio.
You what's up?
I was telling my buddy what you just told me.
Okay.
He's the one that's hurt the horse right here.
What's right there?
He's the one horse's off, so I'm telling him what we're doing.
Okay.
Yeah, let him know that he's in his house.
boat and he's asking us right now on the radio where you're at. They're much north
of the Saltero. They're floating back out.
So cold.
Okay, we do have the latitude and longitude coordinates off your cell phone.
I can't hear you still. I can barely keep your voice, but...
Okay, we've got... Just go ahead and listen. I'll tell you. We've got the coordinates off your cell phone.

Okay.
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.
Hang on just a second.
He's getting out there.
Now we're a little bit left of the building now.
You're a little bit west of the building now?
Yeah, we keep moving west of the wind.
But I bet we're a mile out, three-quarters a mile.
From the building, from the shore, I'd say we're about, I don't know, 500 yards,000 yards, maybe.
About a thousand yards. What was that about 1,000 yards?
We got to. Hang on.
Yeah, he's almost there. You guys got to hang on. Tell him that.
He's almost here.
Okay.
There's some big waves.
Okay, hang on tight.
Huh?
Hang on tight.
He's on his way out.
I can't.
I don't see anybody.
I know.
It'll take him a while.
You might not see until he's right on top of you, so you got to hang on.
All right?
We're coming.
Okay.
He's headed out.
So you got to hang on because he'll be there.
We are trying.
Okay.
And I guess we've got people coming from the Salterre and to Will is sending people.
so there's more than one person coming to help you.
