I'm trying to slow down.
I see them fall down.
Okay, you're stop.
Listen to me, what I want you to do, when you stop, I want you to stay in your car,
and I want you to put your hands on your steering wheel and don't get out until they come up to you, okay?
What do you ask me?
I do.
Listen to me.
Did you hear what I said?
Do you stop?
Oh, stop.
I'll tell you off the car with all the keys.
Did you stop?
Can you slow down?
Okay, are you slow to...
They're not slowing down.
They're not slowing down?
Oh.
Okay.
Do you stop? Did you pull your car over?
I don't want to make them crash.
Okay.
I will tell them that you're going to stop, so they will slow down, okay?
So just flow down and then pull off to the side.
It's him.
And I'm going to tell them on the radio that you're going to do that, okay?
So that they slow down.
Tell them to one of them, but one is behind me, tell them to the office right,
so I know if you know what you're saying.
What's that?
Okay, I can't, slow down just a little bit, I can't hear you.
Tell them, the guy is behind me, telling them to throw off and say it.
You want them to give me a signal?
You want them to turn their lights off?
Anything, anything.
So I can see that he actually hear me.
Okay.
Alright, are you stopping?
I don't see anything.
You don't see anything?
I don't see the signals.
Okay.
All right.
Where are you at? Do you know?
I don't know why that.
Okay.
What's your first name?
Can you please give them a something?
Please tell them to give them to what?
Give them a signal.
I will, okay, I can talk to them on the radio.
What is your first name?
Please do it now because I, please.
My partner is talking to them.
Is your name Lewis?
Yes, please.
Lewis, are you, did you stop your vehicle?
No, yeah.
I don't know if you can hear me if I stop or stop or stop them going.
They can hear me.
Okay, listen to me.
I want you to slow down.
Okay.
And then slowly pull off to the side of the road.
Just slow down and pull off.
And my person that's working with me,
He's going to tell them that you're going to do that, so they slow down, okay?
Because he's more cars.
Because I want, are you pulling over?
They're not showing me nothing.
What?
I need to show me like a signal or something.
You want them to show you something?
Yeah, like, I don't know, turn out of light for a minute, just so I can see that.
You want them to turn their lights off so you know they're going to stop?
Yeah, and I'll stay.
Okay, hold on a second.
Let me tell them that.
Jeff, Jeff, who are behind them just turned their overheads off for a second,
And he said, oh, stop.
If they turn their lights off, you're going to pull over, right?
Yeah.
Okay, they're telling them right now to turn the lights off, okay?
Okay.
So, let me know when you see the lights go off.
I don't see it up there.
Are they still behind you?
Yeah.
Okay.
Do you see the police car?
Yeah, there's two.
Okay, there's two of them, but their lights and sirens are not on anymore, right?
Yeah, they're still on.
The lights are on?
Yes, they're still on.
How fast are you going?
Why not slow down or stop time?
Okay, stop.
I want you to stop, Ray at the stop sign, okay?

Okay.
I want you to slow down and then come to a stop.
They're too close. I don't want to hear.
You know what? They're going to keep staying close until you slow down.
