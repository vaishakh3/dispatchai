9-1-1, where's your emergency?
Well, I'm on 41 going.
I just crossed Chamberlain, and a man pulled up next to me,
and there was a child screaming in the car.
What kind of the vehicle is the end?
It's a blue Camero, like Camero, like in the 90s or early 2000s or something.
Okay, it was a baby or a...
No, it was a child.
You know what?
It's dark, and I turned to look at him, and he's a white male, sort of light-colored hair, sort of plump.
He's behind me now, and I try to slow down so he could pass me, and I could read his license plate.
Okay, ma'am, don't hang up, okay?
I'm not.
Okay.
Okay.
Where are you now, 41-7?
Okay.
I am going to pass across the street, and I believe he's still behind me.
I'm at Jinx drive.
I'm just crossing it.
I'm going very slow, like 45 miles an hour on 41.
And he's behind you?
I believe he's behind me.
He has not passed me, and he's going slower than I am, which is not right because we're holding up traffic and stuff.
But I think that he saw me look at him, and I'm not trying to be overdramatic here,
but he's going even slower now.
And if you're pulling over?
No, something's going on because he's even going even slower now.
Okay.
but he's right behind me.
And I don't know if the kid was, I don't know.
Okay, my name's Jane.
Okay, he's pulling over to the other lane now.
Jane Kowalski, K-O-W-A-L-S-K-I.
And give me your cell phone number in case I lose you.
813-205.
Okay, he's going to turn 205-40-100.
Oh, shit.
And he's going to turn left on Toledo Blade.
He's turning left right now.
Oh.
And I'm in the other lane.
You're going to go south and he's turning left on to the Lido Blades.
Right, and it's like a blue, I want to say like a Camaro type of car, white male.
Okay.
And there's a kid in the back seat, and they kept banging on the window.
Went left on Toledo Blade.
About how old is this child?
Can you tell you?
I did see the child.
I'd say less than 10, definitely not an infant, old enough to bang on the window.
Okay, seven to ten?
I don't know.
Five to ten.
Okay, now it's green and the arrow, green arrows, and he's going now.
He's turning left on Toledo Blade.
Yeah, do you want me to turn?
Try to follow him, or?
Okay, does he want her to follow him?
Okay, can you turn?
Oh, oh, he just turned on Toledo Blade.
I don't know if I can catch up.
There's a bunch of traffic, and I can't get over.
She was a child in the car
someplace between 5 and 10
And it was banging on the window
And screaming
And crying
And screaming
Like screaming, screaming, screaming
And not a happy scream
Like, get me out of here, scream
Left on Toledo Blade
And you said it's a blue Camaro
Blue or black, very dark
He's a white male
and I want to say
sort of light-colored hair
maybe a little
in the face
I don't think obese
but I'm way past there now
for me to go catch them
I don't know if I'd ever be able to go back
I mean I would never stop them
I'm not going to put myself at risk
Okay and I've got your phone number
813
205-4100
And your first name again
It's Jane Kowalski
K-O-W-A-L-S-K-I
I mean, I hope they weren't just playing around.
To me, it sounded like the kid was quiet and panicky, and I don't know.
But instead of taking a chance, I just wanted to make sure I called it in.
I'd feel terrible if something would have ever.
Okay, no, I'm very glad you did, ma'am.
That's exactly what you should do.
Okay, well, you lost him, and thank you now, and we really appreciate you calling us.
Okay, can someone follow up with me?
I mean, or...
Wait, hold on, ma'am.
Okay.
What?
Yes.
Okay, hang on, ma'am.
Okay, the vehicle turned left on Toledo Blade off of 41 Southbound.
She's no longer with the vehicle.
The vehicle had a white male driver, blue or black Camaro.
Male had light hair, and there was a child screaming in the car.
And banging on the window.
Okay.
And banging on the window.
I'm going to get everybody hollering at me, and I may need you to pull over, so just bear with me.
That's fine.
Okay.
I'm going to just pull over now.
Let me get over.
Yeah, that would be great.
Okay, I'm glad you called in.
Yeah, me too.
I mean, I don't know if there's an amber alert out or something like that, but.
Bear with me.
And where are you pulling over?
I just pulled over into the Toys Rots.
Okay, at the Town Center Mall?
Town Center Mall, yeah.
Okay, that's excellent.
I'm from Tampa.
I'm going down to Fort Myers to visit my sister.
I don't even know where I am, actually.
You're going where?
I'm going down to Fort Myers to visit my grandmother and my sister.
So there's a Chili's there, and there's a Toys Lock.
Tell me what kind of car you're in.
It's a Silver Mercedes 380.
Okay.
Okay, if you'll just sit there
And your doors are locked, right?
Oh, well, yeah, I mean
No, no, I mean sit in the car
I always have my doors locked
Oh, that's probably a good idea afterwards
Yeah, okay, all right
Liz
Kirby, do they want to make contact with her?
She's pulled over
Hang on, bear with me here
41 south left, yeah, he'd be heading
to the interstate
I appreciate you holding on, Jane
No problem
I just
Well, actually I hope it's not to be nothing
Really
But I mean I would never
She's pulled over in the toys are off parking lot
Do they want contact with her
I have all that
I gave it to you
Okay
I'm asking you
They want contact with her
Yes
Okay
Jane we
have your phone number. If we need you, we'll call you back. You'll be on that cell phone number
if we need you, right? Absolutely. And don't hesitate. I'll give you whatever information I can give
you. Okay. And we really appreciate you calling in. Yeah. Okay. Well, God, I hope. Man, oh, man. Okay.
Thank you. All right. Thank you. All right. Thank you. All right. Bye-bye.
