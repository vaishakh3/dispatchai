Okay.
I just need to, I need you to be able to get to him as best you can,
and I need you to be able to get him flat on his back.
Well, I have a man on his left side at the moment.
We need to be able to keep his airway open so that he can be.
breathe.
Okay.
What exactly, you said it was a single wound to the head, correct?
Okay.
And if Abel, we need to be able to control the bleeding the best we can, too.
How do I need to do that with the tail?
Well, I can tell you how to do it, but I'd really be best if you could come back to me.
Just, if you could just get a clean, dry cloth or towel and place it right on the wood.
and press firmly and don't lift it up to look and if he keeps bleeding you're probably not
pressing hard enough.
Okay.
Was there an exit wound as well or is just injury?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Let me go out.
He's not really bleeding that much.
He's not bleeding.
Is he still breathing?
Yes, he's still breathing.
Okay.
You know, it's, you know, you can hear him sort of guggling, but not, you know.
Okay, just...
The same way it was.
Okay, I just...
I believe it went in.
I swear, I believe it went in at the, maybe the temple or the eyebrow.
Okay.
Okay, I just, I need you to be able to get out to him
and lay him flat on his back and don't put any pillows under his head.
I need you to kneel next to him and look at his mouth.
for food or vomit.
No, he's not vomiting during anything.
Okay.
Since he's breathing this way, wouldn't it be better to leave him like he is and not
move him?
Well, we just need to be able to maintain his airway.
And I just want you to be able to...
How long will it be until the...
They're going to be coming there as quickly as they can, okay?
I can't tell you how wrong exactly, but they'll be coming there as quickly as they can.
and just be sure not to put any direct pressure on the wound
if there's any visible fracture bone or anything like that.
Okay.
There's don't appear to be any, you know, large amount of blood.
Okay.
And I just, we need to be able to get him flat on his back
and get his hand, get your hand on his forehead
and your other hand under his neck and tilt his head back
and just be sure to keep his airway open like that.
but I can't do that and come back to the phone.
So just stay out there with him.
If you, there's no way that you can get this phone any closer than you are.
No.
The main thing is we need to be able to monitor his breathing
and make sure he continues breathing.
I'd rather stay on the line with you,
but it would be, is there any way that there's no one there with you
that could call on a cell phone or anything like that?
I'd prefer to keep you on the line.
If you'll hold on just a second for me, okay?
Okay.
I'll put you on hold for just a second.
Are you still there, sir?
Hello?
Hello?
Yes.
You still there, sir?

Is he still able to breathe?
Yes.
Okay.
The main thing is you need to monitor that as the best you can, okay?
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah, they're here.
They're here.
Thank you.
Oh, thank God.
Okay.
You'll just stay separated from the weapon, okay?
Yes, yes, yes.
Tell me when they're right there with you, okay?
Just tell me when they're right there with you, okay?
I'm going to stay on the phone with you, okay, until they're right there with you.
Okay.
Or do you want me to step to the door?
If you could just let me know when they're there with you, if they, if they, if they, if they,
Oh, well, they're on the porch.
They're on the porch, okay.
Okay, if they're there with you, you can go ahead and step outside, okay?
