Okay, Weston, tell me exactly what happened today.
My house is on fire.
I don't know, I was sleeping and I was doing
and there's...
My house was engulfed in smoke.
Okay, is everybody out of the house?
No, I think there's people upstairs. I don't know.
How many people would be upstairs?
Two.
Two? Yeah.
And do you know what caused the fire?

East Memorial Drive and Wheatland, Iowa.
Okay, what's going on there?
My ex-girlfriend just called me.
Her whole house is full of smoke.
She can't see.
She has her two-year-old boy with her.
Okay.
Is she getting out of the house?
She's trying to, but she cannot see.
I told her, grab the boy and try to get out of the house.
Okay, we had gotten another call.
We're dispatched in the fire department, okay?
Okay.
Is her apartment upstairs?
Yes.
Hers is on the upstairs, yes.
And how do you get?
into the upstairs. Is an outside staircase or inside? It's the inside staircase, ma'am. You have to go
inside the house. Okay, I'm trying to locate her so that I can tell a fire department in the case she doesn't
get to the door, okay? That's why I'm asking you these questions. Oh, that's fine. I'm sorry. Okay, you go up the
stairs and where's her door to her apartment? On what side? To the right or to the left? Okay, when you
go into the house, ma'am, you have to go to the left and then to the right.
And then there was a staircase on the right in the middle of the house,
and it'd be that door to shoot her upstairs.
Okay.
And she has children?
How many children?
She has a two-year-old with her.
And she was going to try to get out?
Yeah, I just hung up the phone, and she was trying to get out with them,
and they're both freaking out.
And I'm like, I...
Okay, what's her cell number?
It's in my phone, ma'am.
I don't remember it off top of my head.
She just switched numbers.
Okay.
Okay, we've got help on the way, okay?
Okay, do you want me to call you back with the number?
If you can, we want to make contact with her.
Make sure she's getting out of the house.
My partner has somebody else on the phone right now also, okay?
Okay, well, if you hang on one minute, let me see if I can get into it.
Okay, go ahead.
9-1-1. What's the address of the emergency?
