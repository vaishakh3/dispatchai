Okay, ma'am, what is the problem?
A white female passenger passed out on 1.

And this is a female that fainted?
Yes.
Are you in contact with them?
No, I have to operate on the other lines, so I've got to switch back.
In other words, you're in contact with them.
Is that correct, ma'am?
Yes.
Okay, she's still unconscious?
Yes.
Is she breathing?
Yes.
All right, ma'am, I'm going to ask some questions.
I do have far as far aske on the way.
Ask them, is she breathing normally?
Hold on a second.
Okay, she said no, she's not breathing normal,
and there's fluid coming out of the mouth.
Okay, then what I need to you to do is I need for you to turn her to her side.
Mm-hmm.
Tankley not her nose and mouth.
All right, I have to tell her for today.
Hold on a minute.
Hello?
Mm-hmm.
Okay.
Dave is saying now that she's not moving.
she just limped.
Okay, fine.
Let her head flat on her back.
There's nothing under her head.
I hope they had to clean out her nose and mouth
and they said the fluid was coming out.
Okay, now I need for them to place one hand on her forehead,
the other one under her neck,
and you're going to tilt her head back.
Okay.
All of it.
Mm-hmm.
Hello?
Oh.
Okay, she did it.
Okay.
Now, once they place the hand on her forehead and tilt her head back,
Mm-hmm.
I want them to put their ear next to her mouth.
Can you feel or hear any breathing?
Okay.
Hold on a second.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, they say she's gassing for air.
Okay, so she's not breathing, is that correct?
Mm-hmm.
Okay.
Okay. Now, what I need for you to do is that if she's having, I want you to tell me that's what she's doing. If her breathing, it's not good?
Mm-hmm. I want you to tilt her head back some more.
Okay. Hold on a second.
Okay. They said she's turning colors and she's like gasping every so often.
Okay. Then this is what I'm going to tell you to do, okay?
I want you to, if her breathing is not good, what I want you to do, ma'am, is her breathing.
I'm going to tell you how to help her, okay?
Now, what I want them to do is I want them to tilt her head back, okay?
Let's make sure I'm going to tell you how to do chest impressions, okay?
Make sure she'll do that on her back on the ground.
Okay.
Take the heel of your hand on her breastbone in the center of her chest, right between the nipples.
Put your other hand on top of that hand.
and then you're going to push down from the two inches
on the heel of your hand, touching the chest.
Okay.
Okay, hello.
Hello?
Yes, I'm right here, ma'am.
Okay, my rescue is there.
Yes, ma'am. I'm aware of that, okay.
All right.
Thank you.
