It's the house.
What's the emergency there?
I'd rather not say.
Okay, well, if you're calling 911, it's my job to find out, so I need to know what the emergency is.
I think it's a murder.
What makes you think that?
Because I stabbed someone.
Okay. And where are you at?
I'm at Circle K on 35th Avenue in Deer Valley.
And who is this that you stabbed?
Google Austin Tapia.
Where did you stab them at?
I think I stabbed them in the chest and in the neck and in the head.
Okay.
And who is this person?
This is Hugo Tapia's son.
But how do you know him?
He lives in the house with me.
Oh, okay.
So he's your roommate?
He's a family or he's a relative.
Okay.

Honestly, I just felt like killing.
Okay.

No, I have not.

It's in my pocket.
Okay.
Which pocket is it in?
I believe my right pocket.
Okay.
Okay.
All right.
I'm using someone else the phone and they have to leave.
Okay.
You want to just pick me up here?
Can you let them know that it's 911?
So if they could just hang on just a minute, it won't be too too long.
We're just going to come talk to you, okay?
But it's going to stay on the phone because I want to make sure we get to the right place, okay?
All right.
I'm going to phone for a little bit that you have to talk to, I mean.
Just let him know it's 911, okay?
He said he can be late for class.
Okay.
Can you hand the phone to him really quickly?
Sure.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Hello?
Sir, this is the Phoenix police.
It's really important, and I understand you have to get to class,
but this is a very important situation.
Well, he gave you the address to where he's at.
You can call that person.
I understand, but it has to do with him in your...
Well, I don't know what to tell you.
I helped out as much as I could.
I was the only one who was on the phone, so...
Thank you.
It's not much help, but thank you.
Your cars have engines.
You can get here faster than that.
Okay, well, I'm not going to argue with you, so thank you.
And do it's covered in blood, so I think you would get over here quick.
We are as quickly as we can, but I don't want to let a suspect go.
I like to keep them on the phone to make sure we get the right person.
Yeah, I mean, I would be more than willing to stop over here if you wanted to, like, okay with that school or something like that.
But I don't know what's telling you.
I'm sure the officers will do as much as they can to help you with that excuse.
I'm positive that they will help you in this situation.
Okay.
So as long as you can help me out, that would be amazing, and I would greatly appreciate your help.
Okay, well, all right, so what, you guys are on the way over here then?
As fast as we possibly can, we are absolutely on the way.
I just want to keep him talking because it's the best thing I can do right now.
All right, well, I'll leave my phone with him,
and you can have one of the officers get the phone and then bring it to me at the school then, right?
Where do you go to school, and I'll make sure that happens?
MMI, the motorcycle mechanic school right down the road.
Is there a certain room we need to go to?
Who are we in?
Do you want to write that down?
Absolutely. I have all of that information. You have no idea how much I appreciate you helping, and I'll make sure that gets back to you, okay? Okay. Okay. Thank you. All right. Hi. Hi, Andrew. I just wanted to make sure we stayed on the phone, okay. All right. All right. Just let me know. Honestly, that was a kill for U.S. Marshall because I support U.S. Marshal. Oh, okay. That's what it is. That's what it is. Okay. Did you work for them at all?
Um, honestly, it's classified.
Oh, okay. You don't have to tell me.
Was there anybody else at the house?
Uh, nobody else.
Okay. And just let me know when you see the officers again, they just want to talk to you, okay?
Sorry.
You want me to stay on the phone with you?
If you can, if you don't mind.
Have you taken any kind of drugs or anything like that today?
Not today.
Okay. Do you normally at all?
Um, I'm actually.
Actually, I think I'm clean.
You are?
Oh, okay, that's good.
What did you use to take?
I'd rather not say.
Okay, so you don't have to, just making conversations.
I'd rather not say for that question.
No, you don't have to answer.
It's not a problem, okay?
Are you heard that all?
Honestly, honestly, I, actually, I don't think I'm that hurt.
I mean, I might have, like, a little bit of, a little bit of cuts.
A little cut.
But it's not, it's not bleeding, I think.
Okay, so you don't even impairments?
I don't know.
I don't know. There's blood everywhere. There's blood.
There's blood everywhere?
Yes.
Okay.
Well, you just let me know if you're injured and you need medical attention, okay,
because I want to help you out.
Am I going to the mental hospital or am I going somewhere else?
You know what?
I am not an officer, so none of that is up to me.
What we want to do is just help you, okay?
That's our job.
Are you still inside the Circle K or did you go outside?
I'm still inside the Circle K.
I see the SUV.
Should I walk outside?
You know what?
Let me ask them what they want you to do, okay?
All right.
I'm just going to ask them real quick, okay?
All right.
All right.
So you do see the officers outside?
I see the officers.
Okay.
Go ahead and walk outside if you want to stay on the phone you can
or if you want to hang up.
That's okay. Okay.
