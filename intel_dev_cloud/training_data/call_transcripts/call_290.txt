Okay.
Hey, young man.
Hey.
Where are you in my middle?
I am.
ma'am I'm in the third floor I just took the phone away from the senior who I think witnessed what just took place
I'm on the third floor where is the shooter in the building I'm on the shooter was on 316 I think he built the 316 which would be at the
the west side of the building on the third floor okay you still have a weapon I can't tell you that I was
a class when I heard students screaming coming down the hall and I walked out to see what was going on.
Do you still hear shots being fired?
No, he shot one time.
He fired one round as all I did not hear it at the other end of the building from where I am at right now.
I'm on the east end of the building.
Okay.
So you face the building on the right side.
Oh, wow.
Okay.
And the young man that you're with me believes that the young man shot himself.
Okay.
We got a report the person with the gun is a .
Is that correct?
That's my understanding, yes, sir.
Okay.
And we also have a report that he may have shot himself.
Is that correct?
That's what I'm understanding, yes.
Okay.
All right.
Did he...
I will stay on the phone as long as you need me to.
Okay.
and anybody else?
He did not fly the weapon
and anyone else?
Everybody just took off running, I believe.
He didn't go to be overhanded
on the ground on the ground
and the time he was here
said he was kind of shaking
when he came into the room.
He went into one corner
I guess is that when he pulled the weapon?
Yes.
The young man is with me
is very shaken right now.
He said the other
students want to the other side of the room.
And I guess if that one, that's a hard weapon,
yeah, that's what he's saying.
So I don't know if the young man's down in the room.
Okay.
I don't, who's teacher?
What is it?
Listen to me, okay.
The police are in the building, they've made entry,
they're going up to the third floor, and it's room 316, right?
316, correct?
Okay.
He thinks it's three.
He's pretty sure.
I'm at the other end of the hallway.
It's in the computer wing of the building.
They came up the stairs.
It would be the doors to the right at the top of the third floor.
Is there only one stairwell going up there?
There is a stairwell that comes in the back side of the left side of the building.
Okay.
I should, yeah, the left side of the building.
There's a stairwell that comes up down there.
by the business office.
It comes up the back side, and then the entry coming in from the main side of the building,
like I said, the top of the stairs on the right-hand side.
There are three classrooms there.
They are all computer labs.
There's a bathroom, there also, and a room that holds all of the computer components.
Okay.
What I'm hearing in the room here,
Is it the scene's been secured, that's right.
Okay.
All right.
Run and down?
Okay, so apparently this, here's what I'm gathering, okay?
I don't want to, just everybody stay in their classrooms, nobody moves.
Everybody is in the room, right, until we hear otherwise.
We will not move.
Yeah, do not move, but here's what I'm hearing is that it's a suicide,
nobody else injured, and the weapon secured is what I'm, what I'm hearing.
But just keep everybody secured.
Have you made a broadcast throughout the building for everyone to remain in their rooms?
Is there a PA there?
Yes, there is. Hold on second.
I'll get back to him just a minute.
I'll get back to him just a minute, okay?
Hold on.
That was another teacher.
Okay.
There are PAs.
Okay, if you can get it.
There are phones and find it from.
Okay, get them.
Go ahead.
I'm sure the office is going to, it pretty much knows what's going on by this time.
Okay.
If you can just get the word, Tom, we need them to make a broadcast.
Everyone remain in their rooms.
I will do that.
Okay.
No, hang on one second.
You're going to call to me in office right now.
I put my glasses on so I can through it.
Are you the 911?
Yeah, this is Hamilton County 911.
Oh, okay.
Okay.
Let's see here.
I'm calling the main office right now.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm sure that they're in contact with the police officer.
officers on scene, and I'm sure because they're not answering the phone, they're probably back in the back room.
Okay.
And they won't answer, no.
They're not going to answer the phone right now.
Okay, that's fine.
So I'm sure the officers on scene will tell them exactly what they need to do.
Okay, okay.
All right.
Do you leave anything else in here, or can I...
No, you can go ahead and connect, sir.
I appreciate all the info.
Okay.
Thank you very much.
All right.
Bye.
You've seen him?
I don't want an emergency to stopting him.
This is LaSalle High School.

I haven't heard it, but one of the teachers just came down and told us.
Where is he at in the building?
Third floor right now.
Anyone injured?
Not that I'm aware of.

Do you know the student's name?
No, the teacher that came in here did not tell me that at all.

Okay.
I mean, he was pretty shaken, I'll be honest, so it must be kind of serious.
Do you know where in the building he's at, other than the third floor?
No.
All I know is third floor.
We're not a real big building, so, okay?
All right.
So we have any idea if anybody's injured, anything like that?
He did not say that, so I would say probably not.
Did anyone see him or?
I did say, you saw him with the gun?
He said, yes, the students have seen him.
So I don't know what that means either.
I know I'm just a lot of help.
No, no.
A gun, how many guns?
No, he just had a gun.
I'm sorry.
We just moved quick to get this lockdown.
And where is the teacher that saw him?
He took off back out, I guess, to go upstairs.
Okay.
He's one of our, he's like an administrator.
He's our director of guidance.
And so you did hear shots or somebody did hear shots?
I did not.
I did not.
So I don't know if somebody did or not.
He, yeah, I mean, he's not, I know he's for real.
He came flying in here and he said, lock down, call 911 right now.
And he got on the PA and said, everyone were on lockdown at this moment,
follow lockdown procedures, paid immediately or something like that.
And then the principal came out and said, what's going on?
And Tom said, there's somebody upstairs with a gun and they're shooting.
That's all I know.
But I don't, I never heard it.
I don't know.
And I'm just one floor below.
Okay.
I've got police officers responding.
I've went ahead.
We've got a light squad going as well.

Okay, I can hear the...
I think they're pulling in right now.
Yeah, they are.
I can see them, but I can't let them in without putting the phone down.
Okay.
Is there somebody there in the office with you that can see you as you go to the front door?
Yeah.
Yeah, they're here.
They're at the door.
Okay.
Okay, if you don't feel safe going out there, then...
No, I'm okay with that.
Actually, I think they're coming in.
I think they're coming in.
Yeah, because we did not get to lock the main doors,
but they can't get past me without me buzzing them in.
Okay.
And they're running up the steps right now.
