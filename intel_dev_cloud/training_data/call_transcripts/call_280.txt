I think his wife is wrong with his wife.
He's doing what?
Something's wrong with his wife.
He doesn't speak very good English.
Medically wrong?
Yeah.
Where you at?
On Garfield, right by 22 miles off the side of the road.
You're on Garfield, just south of 22?

What kind of car you had?
It's a red jeep.

And there's blood and...
Okay, okay.

The baby's not crying.
Is the child breathing?
I can't.
The baby's not crying.
It's not breathing right now.
It's not breathing?
I know, I know.
Not that I can tell, though.
Okay, you need to try to stimulate the baby's breathing.
Rub his back with your fingertips.
Love his back, with the fingertips.
Is the bellococor still attached?
Oh, yeah.
It is?
Try to keep the baby's head supported.
as you can't. Just like that.
Hold the baby so the head is supported, too, okay?
Hold them this way.
You keep the head supported.
We want to keep that neck and head supported.
Keep them supported.
No, hold them this way.
Hold them out here.
There you go.
And you just rub his back with your career touch.
You got any blankets or anything to try to wrap it out?
Yeah, he's going to blanket.
Okay, okay.
Is it the cord not around it?
No.
Okay.
Is the baby full term?
Yes.
It is full term?
Yeah.
Did the baby start breathing with the back rubs?
No, it's still not breathing.
It's still not breathing.
How's its color?
Pale, very pale.
The cord is not wrapped around its neck or anything, is it?
No.
Okay.
We try to do some CPR on him if he's not breathing.
You want me to do CPR?
Is any...
Is the baby not breathing at all?
Yeah.
Not breathing at all.
Not breathing at all?
No.
Okay, is he laying on his back?
Yeah.
Okay, we need to make sure that his mouth is open.
Nothing's blocking the tailway.
Is there anything in his hand or in his mouth, I mean?
Okay, we're going to put one hand on his forehead.
Is there anything in his mouth?
Anything blocking his airway?
Nothing.
We need to make sure his mouth and airway aren't blocked.
Okay, I don't see it.
Okay, put one hand on his forehead and the fingers of your other hand just under the bony part of his chin.
You're going to tilt his head back just a little, but not too much, okay?
Okay.
Okay.
Did the baby make any movement or anything?
Can you feel if the baby's breathing?
No, baby's not breathing.
Okay.
You're going to need to open his mouth and you've already checked if anything's inside, correct?
Yep.
Okay.
Are you willing to do rescue breaths?
Yeah, I can do it.
Okay.
You're going to cover the baby's mouth and nose with your mouth.
Okay.
You're just going to put two little puffs of air into his mouth, okay?
It's two slow breaths.
Two slow breaths?
Two slow breaths?
You have two slow breaths.
You should be able to see his chest rise.
All right, I did too slow.
Okay, did you see his chest move?
Yeah.
Is she moving or doing anything now?
No, nothing.
Nothing?
Okay, we're going to do some chest compressions, okay?
Oh, yes.
She is moving?
Yeah.
The baby's moving?
Yep.
Is it crying?
Yeah.
The baby is crying now?
It's like whimpering.
It's whimpering, so...
Yeah.
Can you see if it's breathing?
You check to see if she's breathing?
Yeah, let me see.
Put your ear down by her mouth if you have to just to see if you can hear anything.
Hold on one second.
Okay.
She's breathing.
She's breathing?
She's breathing?
Got it wrapped up?
Yep.
Okay, and the umbilical cord is still attached, correct?
Yes.
Okay, because you don't want to cut.
Okay.
And the baby's still breathing, right now, crying?
What's the baby doing?
Just breathing, whimpering.
Just still breathing and whimpering?
Okay, you got towels or blankets around her to try to keep the baby warm too?
Yeah, we got a blanket.
How's mom doing?
Are you okay?
Is mom doing okay?
Yeah, she's okay.
She's doing it?
Yeah, she's okay.
Okay.
Okay.
He's just worried about the baby.
Yeah, no, just keep an eye on that breathing on the baby.
Okay.
Is the umbilical cord pulsating at all? Can you tell?
Um, no, I can't tell, okay.
I can't tell, okay.
I can hear the amy going, though.
