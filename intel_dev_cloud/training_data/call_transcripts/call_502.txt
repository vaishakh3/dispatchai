Hello, you're at Burger King, Boulevard?
Yeah, I don't have the address in the road.
When I hear to buy something, I place another.
When I get there, I'm in the window, I tell the lady I want the lemonade, first limonet.
She says, we don't have a lemonade.
I say, why you didn't say that to me before?

No, I move the car.
Okay, move the car then.
If I'm hungry, what thing, why she says he's not going to give me the food?
Sir, come on, come on, come on.
I know you don't seriously think that the police need to make Burger Pink give you food
factor.
I cannot believe that.
Oh, she's doing, she's watching people.
That's the way she's going to come.
So just wait in the parking lot.
You can't block their drive-through, though, okay?
Do you understand that?
Okay.
Are you driving away?
Jean.
Hello?
Hello?
Drive-through?
Yeah, I'm moving car.
Okay.
Yes or no, so are you still in the parking lot?
Yeah.
Do you want the police to come and talk to you?
But I don't like the way she's acting with the customer.
I'm a customer.

If she has some problem wrong, when she's coming here, she's supposed to be nice.

911 is if you're dying.
Do you understand that?
Okay.
Don't call 911 because you're unhappy with somebody's customer service.
I understand that you don't think she should be rude to you,
but you can't call 911 for that.
No, I don't want to know.
Okay.
Do you understand that?
Okay.
All right, so don't forget that's emergency.
Okay.
All right, hold on one second.
Yeah, I'm coming here to buy some food here.
I get the window and she's asking me what I need.
I say, I need number 7,

She said, okay, when I get the window, she said,
we don't have someone that.
I have code.
