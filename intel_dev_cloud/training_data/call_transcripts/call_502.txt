Hello?
What's your out of us?
I can barely hear it to share.
What's your out of the Burger King on Quentin Beach Boulevard?
Okay, what's going on the line?
Go ahead, sir.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello, you're at Burger King, Boulevard?
Yeah, I don't have the address in the road.
When I hear to buy something, I place another.
When I get there, I'm in the window, I tell the lady I want the lemonade, first limonet.
She says, we don't have a lemonade.
I say, why you didn't say that to me before?
Okay, now, are you in, sir, listen to me.
Are you in the drive-in or are you in the store?
I'm in the driving.
All right, are you blocking the customer?
No, I'm going to three places.
He's going to let me make me stay here for 15 minutes, that's what he said.
Okay, this is what they give me the food.
Okay, if the food's not done, sir, the food's not done.
The food is done, she says she's going to meet me staying here for 15 minutes because I'm talking too much with her.
That's what she said.
I come to miss me.
What's your name?
And Jean Portion.
Jean Portion?
Yes.
Okay.
I'm in a back in Montero.
Okay.
If they want you to move from the window, 911, because you're unhappy with your burger, okay?
Do you understand?
What about the food in fine mode?
What about the time?
If it takes 15 minutes to cook, it takes 15 minutes to cook, okay?
You don't need to call 911.
See, the food is ready.
She's going to make me stay here because I'm a bad drag
is going to make me stay here for 15 minutes.
The food is ready already.
Are you going to move your car out of the drive,
Bruce, sir, and wait.
Wait.
Let me have a couple of you, but she says she's going to make with their wheel.
Like what she says.
Okay.
Have you given them any money?
Huh?
Have you given them any money?
No.
No?
No.
Have they given you any food?
No.
Okay, then you can drive away, sir.
No, I move the car.
Okay, move the car then.
If I'm hungry, what thing, why she says he's not going to give me the food?
Sir, come on, come on, come on.
I know you don't seriously think that the police need to make Burger Pink give you food
factor.
I cannot believe that.
Oh, she's doing, she's watching people.
That's the way she's going to come.
So just wait in the parking lot.
You can't block their drive-through, though, okay?
Do you understand that?
Okay.
Are you driving away?
Jean.
Hello?
Hello?
Drive-through?
Yeah, I'm moving car.
Okay.
Yes or no, so are you still in the parking lot?
Yeah.
Do you want the police to come and talk to you?
But I don't like the way she's acting with the customer.
I'm a customer.
I'm coming here to buy some things, to buy some food.
If she has some problem wrong, when she's coming here, she's supposed to be nice.
life with people.
Okay.
I understand that, but that's not a police service.
It's not a reason to call 911.
911 is if you're dying.
Do you understand that?
Okay.
Don't call 911 because you're unhappy with somebody's customer service.
I understand that you don't think she should be rude to you,
but you can't call 911 for that.
No, I don't want to know.
Okay.
Do you understand that?
Okay.
All right, so don't forget that's emergency.
Okay.
All right, hold on one second.
Yeah, I'm coming here to buy some food here.
I get the window and she's asking me what I need.
I say, I need number 7,
lemonette.
She said, okay, when I get the window, she said,
we don't have someone that.
I have code.
I have code.
I say I don't need coke.
Give me the limonet.
Why you didn't say that to me before?
You're supposed to tell me you don't have a limonet, okay?
Ending date.
