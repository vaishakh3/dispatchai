Even police, Hollinger.
Hi, how are you?
Good.
I'm sitting in the park at West Boulevard by the West Boulevard Rapid Transportation Station.
And there was a guy in there with a pistol, you know, it's probably fake, but he's like pointing to everybody.
And where are you at, sir?
I'm sitting in the park at West Kudel, West Boulevard by the West Boulevard Rapid Transit Station.
Are you, so you're at the rapid station?
Are you at the rapid station?
No, I'm sitting across the street in the park.
What's the name of the park?
Kudel?
Kudel, yes.
The guy keeps pulling it in on his, it's probably fake, but you know what?
He's scaring the shit on.
What does he look like?
He has a camouflage hat on.
Is he black or white?
He has a gray coat with black sleeves and gray pants out.
Is he black or white?
I'm sorry.
Is he black or white?
He's black.
You said a camel jacket and gray pants?
No, he has a camouflage hat on.
You know what that is?
And his jacket is gray, and he's got black sleeves on it.
He's sitting on a swing right now, but he keeps pulling it in and out of his pants.
Then pointing in there, people.
Probably a juvenile, you know?
Hello?
Do you know the guy?
No, I do not, sure.
Okay, one foot the police, okay?
I'm getting ready to leave, but you know what?
He's right here by the, you know, the youth center or whatever.
I think he's pulling it and out of the stance.
I don't know if it's real or not, you know.
Okay, we'll send a call through.
Thank you.
Thank you.
