Number one center.
Can I get a police on Dryden, Park, and Dewey?
Because they just jumped my 13-year-old daughter, and it's about to be all hell break.
No, she got a scratch on her face up under her chin, but...
Does she know who jumped her?
Yeah, she know who jumped her.
How many people jumped her?
I don't, she said a whole bunch of grown women.
And where are they now?
Eight, nine. I don't know.
Okay, so you're going to be meeting them on the court?
but they're nowhere around.
Yeah, we, um, my daughter, right, where are you at?
You guys are just going to be standing on the corner of Dewey in driving park?
Are you guessing where you are or you know where you're, okay, you're going to be standing
on the corner of Dewee in Driving Park, is there a business?
What's your name?
My name is Tasha.
It's a one-way street and they're standing out with six and nines and everything.
So they're on a one-way street and you're 14.
