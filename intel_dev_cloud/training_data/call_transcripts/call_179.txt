They're right in front of me.
Like, do you guys have any, any kind of cloths, any kind of towels?
No, I mean, no, I mean, there's blood all over.
No cloth is going to stop what's going on right here.
Have you ever seen a massacre?
That's what it looks like right here in the office.
Sir, I understand, but just because there's a lot of blood,
doesn't mean that you can't, that there's no help that you can give these people.
I mean, these people are dying.
They're yelling.
What do you do?
What do you do?
They want privilege.
What do you?
Sir, I understand.
I understand that you guys have just been through something very severe.
