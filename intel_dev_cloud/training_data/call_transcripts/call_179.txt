Three, I think so.
I got, I just know.
just throwing blood out. I mean, he just shot all over. He just wouldn't...
Okay, where are you shot for?
And my arms, I think.
Go all three shots from your arm?
I think they're there. It just feels hot.
But it's not me. I'm worried about it. It's more my supervisor. He gets two by the heart.
Okay, where is he at? Can you tell...
They're all laying down. They're all just laying there.
Okay, where? Because when help gets there, we're going to send them straight into the people who need it first.
So can you tell me where these people are laying?
Right beside me. Right here, I'm calling by the phone. They're right
beside me. Okay, so everybody's like in the same area. Yeah, but what happened was we're having
a safety meeting and one guy went postal, was an injury arm and one post and pulled out on a K-40
and started shooting there. So was he in the meeting? Yeah, he was in the meeting, but he just walked
down and walked back in with the gun and just went crazy. Okay, hold on. Okay, sir. So all of you guys are
in the same place? We're all in the safety. Okay. Sir, I know that, I know that you're injured,
but is there any way that you can tell me exactly where these people are?
They're right in front of me.
Like, do you guys have any, any kind of cloths, any kind of towels?
No, I mean, no, I mean, there's blood all over.
No cloth is going to stop what's going on right here.
Have you ever seen a massacre?
That's what it looks like right here in the office.
Sir, I understand, but just because there's a lot of blood,
doesn't mean that you can't, that there's no help that you can give these people.
I mean, these people are dying.
They're yelling.
What do you do?
What do you do?
They want privilege.
What do you?
Sir, I understand.
I understand that you guys have just been through something very severe.
I totally understand that, but I'm just, you're telling me that these people are dying,
and I'm trying to tell you, if there's any kind of help that we can give them, sir.
I mean, the staff and you can get an ambulance, who are you, the operator?
This is 911 one.
I've got every single deputy on duty is on their way there.
They're probably already there outside.
They're probably looking to make sure that this guy's not still hanging around.
Well, that's what I call them.
I have multiple ambulances coming.
We've got the fire department coming.
Everybody's on their way, sir.
Yeah, okay.
Okay.
So I know it might seem like it's taking a long time,
but we're trying to get there as fast as we possibly can, okay?
All right.
Huh?
What happened?
No, one of the guys just came in and said he died already.
He did.
Do you know his last name?
Yeah.

Okay, did you see what the guy was doing to her?
She was trying to take something from her.
She was on the ground.
