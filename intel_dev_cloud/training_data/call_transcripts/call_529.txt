We are because my trip got broken to about eight months ago.
So we already know who did it.

Guess what? That's so fucking fault.
They're all fucking fuck.
They're all fucking alive.
They don't know.
They just hold him, Jay.

The police on the way.
They don't got his damn CD players.
And it's, God Almighty.
Mm-mm-mm.
The ants laying right here in the damn.
So they got his CD press and stuff and ran with it?
Yeah, and the ants playing right here in the yards.
We called them.
We heard them.
Our dogs started barking.
Mm-hmm.
And.
And.
Hey, what, hey.
Hey, little boy, and where's the CD?
Okay, I'll take you to it.
No, no, Kevin, wait until the police get there, take it to him.
Hey, are you the one broken my shit?
No, sir.
I've got it next to you.
Hey, ma'am, don't let him take you nowhere.
Hold him right there to the police get there.
There's three more kids coming around the street right now.
Okay.
They need to hurry.
Maybe what's about it.
There's three more kids.
Three more white kids coming to the street.
Smoke.
Get in the house.
Say, where you're a little bad at?
Where's your bat?
Your metal bat.
Hey, they're shooting at it.
Lay down.
They are shooting a gun.
They just shot my house.
I heard you.
Shot fire.
Shot fire, don't fit that.
Dug him in the past.
Hey!
They're killed right here.
Oh!

Quit!
Let him go, God, get it!
Quit!
Let him go!
Let him go!
Let him go!
Let him fuck down!

He shot you.
Let me say, no, he hit you with the gun.
Get in the bed, running.
Lay that on the damn floor.
Do you know who it is at?
Yeah.
Okay.
For sure, right here.
He's walking down the street right now with the gun.
Where the fucking are police in to him?
They should.
They should be coming up there.
Police are on, I mean, they're walking in.
Tell me what they got on.
They got on hoodies.
It's the same dudes.
What color?
I mean...
They're white dudes.
These assholes just shot my house up in the police.
They're here.
I've got three kids in here.
This makes no sense.
I got a cop that lives on the corner down here.
Yeah.
It's been three minutes.
It actually.
been three minutes. But all this going on
making sense, it's been a long time.
This don't make no sense. This is how I hear with it.
Okay, they told me
it's being updated that it was four
black males, too. It was in black males or white males?
They were all white males. It was a white girl
and three white dudes that just ran up on my porch.
One of them had a damn shotgun and shot my house twice
and shot my old man.
Is he shot?
Yes.
I mean, you know.
My woman, ma'am, you said he has been hit?
Yes, but...
Talk to me, come on.
It's kind of hard when I know...
No, I mean, did you say he's been hit?
Did he need an animal?
Yes, he's shot.
He's got blood out over him.
Okay.
And we know who it is.
Let me update this.
Jay, they got everything out of your cars.
They live right here.
No.
He just got shot.
Yeah.
She told me her boyfriend been shocked.
He got blood all over him.
And there was all white people.
There wasn't nobody black out there.
It was a white female and three young white males.
They live, I don't know, the white dude's name.
One of them's names, but the cops that worked third shifts, they know the kids in this neighborhood.
He lives on the next street up.
I'm going on there knock on Johnny's going to ask what those names is.
Stay in the house if you can before the boys get there.
You know what's crazy.
And the ambulance would be pulling up to a minute.
I'm not trying to be funny.
But why is there a cop that lives right here on my corner and he don't do shit in this neighborhood?
You know, they don't because they live there really not supposed to.
But I mean, if they got, you know where they live in those apartment complexes?
they make a deal with them to watch the place and do all that.
But when he live in his own house, when he get off and he don't...
This is, you know, ma'am, I'm not trying to be fun.
I know, go ahead.
But I've got three babies in this house, and the police still ain't here yet.
Three.
What's your name, dear?
There's your own fuckers live on the next three, Kyle.
Ma'am, what's your name?
Christy Lewis.
If you can tell me what they got on, they looked for...
The one guy had on black jeans, black hoodies.
We got his damn shoes laying over here in the damn room.
Black hoodie and...
They're not going to be having that on.
These people are going to be in the house now.
The old boy, my old man got a hold of his ass and we had him on the porch,
and then the police should have got here.
And then the other one's coming around the corner with a damn shotgun shooting my house up.
And I couldn't come outside.
I got three babies in here.
This stupid bitch telling Jay to move.
Move, let him go, let him go.
Now, did they hold him, they stick at him?
We don't have nobody.
Dude came up here shooting with a shotgun had it in his head.
Okay.
So we're supposed to hold somebody and get shot.
No, I thought you still had him.
No, they just took off.
That's why I was like, where to have the police?
This makes no sense whatsoever.
I'm going to go down here and knock on Johnny's door.
I'd rather you wait in the house.
Well, the police ain't coming.
They're coming until...
I'd rather you wait until the police get there,
so you're going to go out there and they start shooting at you.
They live on the next street.
They don't live on our street.
I know, but they might be still...
around out there.
Well, now here's the fire department.
Why the fire department comes?
You said your husband's shot, the Amazon fire department comes.
And he's got blood all over him, then they're supposed to come.
They beat the police here?
I'm not trying to be shining.
Now, what they do, a lot of times what they do is, like when I put in there,
that the kids lived on the other street.
that there were three white males won't wait a male.
They'll go that way and look to see if they're saying.
Here they come right now.
The police is here.
Can I hang up with you?
Yes, you can.
Thank you so much, ma'am.
Thank you so much, ma'am.
Okay.
