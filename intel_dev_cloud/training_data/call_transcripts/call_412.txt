Our County 911, do police, fire, or medical help?
Yes, ma'am.
So I think my son's been killed.
Where at?
We're in the Evergreen Trailer Park on
Bolson Street, Trailer 81.
Okay, what's the exact address?
Walton Street, Trailer 81, Evergreen Trailer Park in North Canton.
It is in North Canton City.
I'm going to give you North Canton.
Stay on the line, okay?
Because it's not coming up on my map, so I want to make sure you get the right place.
Stand in the line.
They'll be right with you.
North Kent emergency.
Yes, this is Judy Smith.
I'm at my son's trailer park.
Uh-huh.
And we just broke in and it looks like he's in the bathroom, but his head's missing.
But what?
His head isn't there.
I don't know.
I know it sounds really weird, but...
Wait a minute.
You're in his trailer, and you see him in the bathroom?
It looks like him.
I like to do.
I don't know.
Could you just dispatch an officer?
Yeah, we'll send an officer.
Well, there's a body or there's something there.
I mean, it looks like his legs.
Okay. All right. We'll have an Oscar up, all right?
Okay. Thank you.
