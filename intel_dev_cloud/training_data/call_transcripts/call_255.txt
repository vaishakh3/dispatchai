Okay.
Okay. I don't want you to put yourself in danger, but we have people coming in to help and they're going to need to know where he is, okay?

Okay.
Do you know where he is?
He's in the front yard right now, talking to my mom and the neighbor.
Does he still have the BB gun?
Um, yeah, it's actually an airsoft gun. It's a different gun than I thought, but...
Yeah, he's right out for it in New York.
Um, Aspen Street.
He's headed towards the Aspen Street.
He's running down the street toward Athens.
No.
But yeah, he's headed down the street towards the Aspen Street.
Does he still have the airsoft gun in his hand?
No, no, he put that down.
He put the airsoft gun down?
Yeah. What about the pocket knife?
Does he still have that?
I'm not too sure.
if he does or not.
So when you said he hurt himself or he cut himself earlier, do you know where he heard himself?
The only thing I saw is I saw his arm with the knife.
Okay.
He has a gun that he doesn't have the gun anymore.
Okay.
He's got the gun in his hand.
Is there any way that you can let them know he's got the gun in his hand?
He does still have the airsoft gun in his hand?
It's not real.
I know, I understand.
Well, listen, the officers are trained in this type of thing.
They're not going to go around shooting people, you know, okay?
And they understand the situation here, so we just want to keep everybody safe.
Okay.
Can you still see him?
No, he took off down the road towards Aspen Street.
Okay, he took off running down the road towards Aspen Street and you can't see him anymore?
So he was west on Aspen Creek Drive?
Yeah.
Okay.
And you can't see him anymore.
Okay.
Okay, I've got some officers who are nearby.
Okay.
The first thing that they're going to do is just get Kyle under control so that he's safe and everybody else is safe.
And then probably some officers are going to have to come in.
Okay.
Okay.
Kyle, just, sorry, I'm sorry, Alex, just wait at your house.
Okay, the officer is going to be down there to talk to you short.
Okay?
Okay.
All right.
Bye-bye.

We know.
Thank you.
Bye.
