Okay, and what's wrong tonight, sir?
There is a strange man outside our home, and he's hollering,
and he's crying out.

Can you see anything about him what he looks like?
No, it's dark and raining.
Okay.
Did he have a vehicle, or is he on foot?
He's on foot.
Has he come to your door or windows?

All right, thank you.
Don't hang up with me, okay?
Okay.
No matter, listen, I want to tell you something, no matter what happens, just don't hang the phone up.
You can set it down if you have to.
I don't know.
I think he's got a gun.
Get out of the way, get out of the way.

I don't know if that's what he's got.
Man, can you see the gun?

Man, can you see if he has a gun or not?
I cannot see.
No, we've got louvers on the door and the door is shut.
It's a sliding glass door.
She can't tell.
He told her that he had a gun.
Man, is he able to get in the door?
Not right now.
He's trying.
What?
They don't have, they can't see or hear anything.
Okay, what's he doing now, ma'am?
He's asking what date it is.
He's talking about something about Vietnam in 1969.
He's talking about Vietnam.
I don't want to hurt you, okay?
Is he talking to your husband rationally or is?
No, he is not.
Okay.
Does your husband know him?
No, like I say, we can't even see who it is.
Okay.
We don't know.
Did you hear a vehicle or anything like that pull up or do you?
Or did he just walk?
No, I didn't even know until he was on the back door.
I can't tell.
It's dark.
Okay.
Can you ask your husband to look to see if it looks like he has a weapon?
They're on the way.
They're on the way.
Yeah, they're coming now.
We've got several officers on the way.
Ask your husband to look.
look to see if that man has a weapon.
I do not want to look because he's beaten on the door and I'm afraid if I open the screen, I mean he's going to come through.
Okay.
They're not going to look to see if he has a weapon because if they open the door.
Okay.
What's he doing now?
I don't hear anything now.
Okay.
Where's your husband still at the back door?
We're standing here in the kitchen.
and he is trying to get into the sliding glass door,
which he's trying to get into the sliding glass door.
And what side of the house is the sliding glass door on?
It is in the back of the house.
But I don't love you.

and he's given us a few minutes.
He's counting.
So he's counting down.
The guy outside the house, the guy outside the house is counting down.
He's counting out loud, saying he's going to bust the door down.
I don't want to hurt you.
What kind of gun does your husband have?
I cannot let you in.
Ma'am.
It's like a rifle.
Okay.
If he shot gun, his husband is at the door talking to this guy.
Oh, he's, he's, he's, he doesn't have to be behind the office.
