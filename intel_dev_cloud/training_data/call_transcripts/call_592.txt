911, what's the address of your emergency?
Hi, where's just to know those falls and a little girl just went into the rapids?
Her mom jumped in after them, but they were going down the river pretty fast and everyone's still running after them, so.
Okay, where did it happen at?
Um, just at, just at the base of Briddievale Falls.
But they're, they're, like, flowing down river towards non-parts.
Okay, stand the line with me, okay?
Yep.
How old is the little girl?
I have no idea.
She fell into the river.
Yeah, she went into the river.
She was drifting down and the mom jumped in about a foot from her, but I don't know if she caught her or not.
They both kept on going down the river.
Did they have any flotation or anything?
No flocation, nothing.
Does anybody, can anybody see either of them?
No.
They ran, people are still running after them, so.
