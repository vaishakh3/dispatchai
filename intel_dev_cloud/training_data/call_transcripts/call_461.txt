[01:40:44.420 --> 01:40:45.200]  Repeat that.
[01:40:46.720 --> 01:40:49.040]  I'm running out to the PD to interview a witness.
[01:40:50.840 --> 01:40:52.760]  Copy that. You know smarts are out, correct?
[01:40:54.100 --> 01:40:55.380]  It's top firm. This is per smart.
[01:40:57.220 --> 01:40:57.940]  Copy that.

[01:41:35.010 --> 01:41:35.590]  Go ahead.
[01:41:36.990 --> 01:41:39.750]  To make sure we have a call holding on the screen number 240
[01:41:39.750 --> 01:41:44.310]  regarding a juvenile hiding at best self storage at 77th and 44.
[01:41:44.310 --> 01:41:48.130]  said it was related to the school, shooting was very upset.
[01:41:49.710 --> 01:41:54.410]  Copy. You're going to have to have the on-duty patrol officers to deal with that.
[01:41:54.950 --> 01:41:59.650]  And if it comes up to it's connected, they need to let Smart know or somebody else in C-P.
[01:42:00.950 --> 01:42:02.370]  All 13, I'll be in route.
[01:42:04.050 --> 01:42:04.290]  All 13.

[01:42:41.830 --> 01:42:44.050]  X-ray 20 go ahead
[01:42:44.970 --> 01:42:48.210]  Do you have any students and school buses still at the north end
[01:42:49.550 --> 01:42:52.170]  I have no students but several school buses
[01:42:52.170 --> 01:42:53.190]  I was told there's more coming
[01:42:54.670 --> 01:42:56.390]  Give me a count of the school buses
[01:43:02.140 --> 01:43:03.660]  I have two special
[01:43:04.200 --> 01:43:06.440]  school buses that are empty ready to go pick up
[01:43:06.440 --> 01:43:09.220]  And I have four empty buses ready for pickup.
[01:43:10.420 --> 01:43:10.900]  Copy.
[01:43:11.060 --> 01:43:15.140]  Send two of those buses to 108 the softball field.
[01:43:15.600 --> 01:43:18.780]  We're going to move students that we have sheltered in place south to that.
[01:43:20.380 --> 01:43:22.380]  We don't need the disabled buses.
[01:43:24.040 --> 01:43:25.760]  Not right now. Keep them with you.
[01:43:26.020 --> 01:43:30.140]  I just want two of the school buses that are with you to head south to 108
[01:43:30.140 --> 01:43:32.880]  in the softball field for student pickup.
[01:43:34.100 --> 01:43:34.580]  Copy.
[01:43:34.640 --> 01:43:35.320]  They're on their way.
[01:44:12.630 --> 01:44:15.290]  X-ray-20 to CP. You have two large buses in route.
[01:44:58.750 --> 01:44:59.750]  X-ray-20 to CP.

[01:45:22.350 --> 01:45:25.510]  Do you have any communication with who is what the special needs?
[01:45:25.770 --> 01:45:30.350]  How many buses that I will tell us to share exactly what we need there?
[01:45:35.040 --> 01:45:38.900]  To the south, I need 80 plus students.
[01:45:38.900 --> 01:45:41.520]  move from there to the current collection point.
[01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:46.400]  Mike, we're trying to figure out if we need any wheelchair accessible buses
[01:45:46.980 --> 01:45:48.420]  and where we need them.
[01:45:50.140 --> 01:45:52.060]  I haven't heard that, but stand by.
[01:45:54.200 --> 01:45:56.600]  You have two empty buses on their way.
[01:46:00.910 --> 01:46:03.710]  A. Samtend to McShane. Are you on in Maine?
[01:46:03.710 --> 01:46:04.070]  Are you on, Maine?
[01:46:15.150 --> 01:46:16.810]  Search command to McShane.
[01:46:33.160 --> 01:46:38.700]  And Senator DeRigate Patrol, we have Marysville Police two turned up as well.
[01:47:05.350 --> 01:47:08.090]  8 out of 12 to Officer Hendrick Setticole.
[01:47:12.520 --> 01:47:17.260]  You have the view of 108 of your location.
[01:48:19.510 --> 01:48:23.630]  And Senator Carr is getting a secondhand report area check
[01:48:23.630 --> 01:48:25.890]  of someone jumping the fence at Marysville Middle School.
[01:48:26.090 --> 01:48:26.550]  Call our concern.
[01:48:27.710 --> 01:48:47.580]  Okay, and that's Marysville Middle School.
[01:48:53.320 --> 01:48:56.440]  No description is someone that's up the fence right through the fields.
[01:49:01.500 --> 01:49:03.340]  Transit 17, Marysville, there.
[01:49:05.040 --> 01:49:05.880]  Where are they calling from?
[01:49:08.160 --> 01:49:12.640]  I'm not sure where our caller is, just that they received a text from someone at the school.
[01:49:14.480 --> 01:49:15.540]  Receive all response.
[01:49:15.540 --> 01:49:18.240]  I'm sorry, transit 14.
[01:49:20.360 --> 01:49:20.980]  One-seven.
[01:49:22.060 --> 01:49:22.600]  One-seven, coming.

[01:50:06.020 --> 01:50:07.060]  And center across,
[01:50:07.180 --> 01:50:09.540]  it's information that channel SO data
[01:50:09.540 --> 01:50:12.360]  is being monitored for perimeter and traffic control
[01:50:12.360 --> 01:50:13.640]  for the incident.
[01:50:13.880 --> 01:50:15.820]  SO data is open for that channel.
[01:50:39.960 --> 01:50:41.800]  8 atom 12 to 8 atom 3.
[01:50:50.340 --> 01:50:53.440]  I need Adam 12 to Command Post, Maryland, P.D.
[01:50:58.760 --> 01:50:59.060]  Go ahead.
[01:51:04.500 --> 01:51:06.280]  I need more school buses.
[01:51:06.900 --> 01:51:08.440]  Two more to the north and two to the south.
[01:51:08.600 --> 01:51:11.880]  We have several hundred kids still sheltered in place we want to move off scene.
[01:51:14.440 --> 01:51:16.400]  Can I copy two to the north, two to the south?
[01:51:17.580 --> 01:51:20.140]  I need two more than what I have on scene here.
[01:51:20.440 --> 01:51:21.460]  Two to the north, two to the south.
[01:51:22.740 --> 01:51:23.120]  Copy.
[01:51:27.120 --> 01:51:28.340]  658 is a Cp.
[01:51:29.980 --> 01:51:30.780]  6.5.8.
[01:51:32.880 --> 01:51:38.060]  Where do you want the school district list that shows who got picked up and who can get picked up?
[01:51:40.720 --> 01:51:45.020]  Is that from the parent reunification location or where's that from?
[01:51:48.540 --> 01:51:49.780]  School district's office.
[01:51:52.900 --> 01:51:54.980]  Run that to the command post.
[01:51:54.980 --> 01:51:59.020]  south side of the school.
[01:51:59.060 --> 01:51:59.480]  3-2.
[01:52:02.500 --> 01:52:03.480]  3.20 to C.P.
[01:52:05.520 --> 01:52:05.720]  Go ahead.
[01:52:07.040 --> 01:52:09.000]  Confirming you want some of the buses that I have north,
[01:52:09.160 --> 01:52:10.260]  you need two more to edge your way?
[01:52:12.060 --> 01:52:14.420]  I want to keep some of the north buses north.
[01:52:14.560 --> 01:52:16.860]  You've already set two of the north buses south.
[01:52:17.220 --> 01:52:18.420]  I'm trying to get additional buses.
[01:52:20.100 --> 01:52:23.540]  I want five both sides and three small, so...
[01:52:26.800 --> 01:52:27.280]  How much?
[01:52:27.300 --> 01:52:29.080]  How many students can you move in those buses?
[01:52:30.740 --> 01:52:31.360]  I'll check.
[01:52:34.320 --> 01:52:35.160]  CP to Thomas.
[01:52:35.440 --> 01:52:36.200]  You don't have clear yet.
[01:52:36.200 --> 01:52:36.940]  I'd have to step out.
[01:52:38.740 --> 01:52:39.980]  Nope, still working on it, boss.
[01:52:41.420 --> 01:52:41.880]  Copy that.
[01:53:18.500 --> 01:53:19.780]  X-ray 20 to CP.
[01:53:19.980 --> 01:53:22.360]  I can move over 300 from the north side.
[01:53:27.590 --> 01:53:28.290]  Stand by.
[01:53:28.450 --> 01:53:29.910]  We're going to get students headed your way.
[01:53:31.990 --> 01:53:32.470]  Tommy.
[01:56:19.490 --> 01:56:20.870]  David 1 Adam 12
[01:56:20.870 --> 01:56:23.130]  Adam 12 go ahead
[01:56:24.330 --> 01:56:25.970]  I've got two buses here

[01:56:28.550 --> 01:56:29.340]  where do you want them
[01:56:30.830 --> 01:56:32.710]  right by the softball field
[01:56:32.710 --> 01:56:35.910]  they'll have sins coming from the gymnasium shortly
[01:56:35.910 --> 01:56:37.430]  and then they go to the parent
[01:56:37.430 --> 01:56:38.770]  reunification location
[01:56:40.310 --> 01:56:41.550]  51st and 116
[01:56:44.630 --> 01:56:45.070]  Copy.
[01:56:45.270 --> 01:56:48.270]  So is this entrance or the other entrance by the Tandum's court?
[01:56:52.740 --> 01:56:55.940]  Uh, the closest one to the gym.
[01:57:01.640 --> 01:57:03.580]  I'll copy that. That would be this one then.
[01:57:44.160 --> 01:57:45.660]  Adam Street, Adam L.O.
[01:57:47.380 --> 01:57:47.800]  Go ahead.
[01:57:49.820 --> 01:57:52.800]  Does Prans have been able to get any more information up there?
[01:57:53.860 --> 01:57:59.460]  I don't know. The detectives have moved to the office to start coordinating their crime scene.
[01:58:00.820 --> 01:58:05.540]  Copy that. Is there anybody that's working on information for the CP on these persons?
[01:58:06.920 --> 01:58:09.500]  Franz and in Bartolwer. I asked them to give you a call.
[01:58:09.940 --> 01:58:12.660]  All right, I'll give them a call.
[01:59:51.940 --> 01:59:52.980]  That's the 20th CP.
[01:59:54.580 --> 01:59:55.060]  Cp.
[01:59:55.080 --> 01:59:55.300]  C.

[01:59:57.020 --> 01:59:58.100]  Did you request the tow?
[02:00:00.140 --> 02:00:00.400]  Yes.
[02:00:01.020 --> 02:00:01.880]  Commandpost did not.
[02:00:03.380 --> 02:00:03.940]  How do you think?
[02:00:05.060 --> 02:00:06.960]  I don't know if the detectives have.
[02:00:10.600 --> 02:00:11.080]  Copy.
[02:00:11.080 --> 02:00:11.200]  Please.
