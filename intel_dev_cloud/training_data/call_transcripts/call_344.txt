Police and fire department, can I help you?
Hi there.
My name is in Las Vegas, Nevada.
My daughter and her mother, my former wife,
were involved with an old boyfriend.
who came to where Ken lives and supposedly shot a police officer.
Tell him what the text said.
Was anything at all reported in your station?
Okay, and what was your name?
You're in Las Vegas right now?
I live in Las Vegas.
Right, are you there right now?
Yes, I am.
Okay, can you do me a favor, and hold on just one second.
I'll see if I can get any information for you?
I will hold on, but I do want you to know that I just texted my daughter.
My daughter said that she is being held hostage, and that this crazy guy, Eric, shot a police officer.
I don't know if hopefully he didn't wound him and said, I'm being held hostage.
Pray for me.
She has T-Mobile as her primary phone.
Do you know what her cell phone number is?
Her cell phone number is...
Right, I understand. Hold on one second, sir.
Hold on one second. I understand.
Did you text her back?
Did you text her back?
I did not text her back.
No, I did not.
Well, is there someone on the phone I would recommend texting your daughter back
and acknowledge that she receives her text?
And just tell her you're doing everything you can to help her.
Yes.
Where does, Brian?
Brian, I just got a text from
He was just moved, she wrote
I don't know what that means
He was sitting on the chair
Pardon me
Oh, he moved
He was sitting on the chair
And then what?
Here's what you wrote
Exactly what it was
He was just moved
That was at 617
Which is 817 year time
He was sitting on chair
Talking to me
And then she wrote
They can see me
in window well.
She must be referring
to the police.
She must be referring to the police.
I'm guessing. That's what you said.
He was just moved.
He was sitting on chair talking to me.
They can see me in window well.
That's what she wrote to me.
Okay.
Just four minutes ago.
So they're still together then.
Right.
So could you ask?
Can you ask her if she's able to talk to you or if he's not letting her talk?
Well, if he's going to...
I don't know if he's reading her text messages, I don't want to say too much.
That's what I'm saying.
I think he's probably reading her text messages.
I would imagine that.
If he's got a gun, sir, I've got to be real careful.
Right, I understand.
That's why I'm trying to be as careful as I can also.
Hold on a second.
I just want to talk on the radio again.
Okay.
unless she's texting me and erasing her text immediately after she gets it.
Say that again?
Unless she's, when she text me or I text her, she immediately erases it.
Right.
I don't know.
But I want to let you know that in the window well.
So that's where she is, see her in the window well.
Okay.
I'll let the officers know that, and then if we get any further information
or if you get any further information,
then give us a call back.
I will.
Thanks, Brian.
Okay, thank you.
Bye-bye.

He was sitting on the chair.
Pardon me?
Oh, he moved.
He was sitting on the chair and then what?
Here's what she wrote,
exactly what it was.
He was just moved.
That was at 617, which is 817.
in your time he was sitting on chair talking to me and then she wrote they can see me in window

you said he was just moved he was sitting on chair talking to me they can see me in window well
that's what she wrote to me
just four minutes
so they're still together then
right so
could you ask her if she's able to talk to you
or if he's not letting her talk

I don't know if he's reading her text messages
I don't want to say too much

I would imagine
If he's got a gun, sir, I've got to be real careful.

Hold on a second.
I talk on the radio again.
Okay.
Unless she's texting me and erasing her text immediately after she gets it.
Say that again?
Unless she's, once she texts me or I text her, she immediately erases it.
If she's doing that.
I don't know.
But I want to let you know that.
Okay.
I'll let in the window well, so that's where she is, see her in the window well.
Okay, I'll let the officers know that, and then if we get any further information,

This is Brian.
Brian?
Brian, yes.
Yeah, she just called me and said that he needs a phone, a cell phone.
That he does?
Yeah, he needs a cell phone.
There's all kinds of cell phones outside, I'm sure.
But he wants the cell phone, and he's getting upset that he doesn't have one.
Okay, hold on one second.
Did his cell phone die?
Because I thought he had a cell phone.
Hold on one second.
She was talking about the cell phone dying or something, but he needs a cell phone.
He has a mother that works at a restaurant, and she's a waitress there.
I don't know the name of it.
So I don't know if he wants to talk to her or what.
So did you want the police to give him a cell phone?
He wants a cell phone.
Nass to call me up and she said he wants a cell phone.
Why can't he get a cell phone?
And she was very agitated.
She's trying to work with Eric to get him a cell phone.
Okay.
So somehow she's looking for a cell phone and he may be getting answered if he doesn't get it.
Okay.
Okay. And he didn't want to, he didn't use her cell phone?
I'm just asking.
I don't know. She's using her cell phone to talk to me.
Right. So he knows that, does he know that you're in contact with her?
I don't know.
All right.
I have no idea. I would assume that he does.
Okay. And do you know if he was, if he said that he wanted to talk to his mom who, is she, do we know that?
Is the mom currently at work, do we know?
That I don't know.
Don't know.
The mother lives with him.
I don't know the address, but if he wants a cell phone, I don't know who he wants a call.
I'm assuming it's his mother, but I...
Okay.
All right, I'm going to let the officers know.
I don't know.
I don't know if they're able to give him his cell phone.
I don't know.
I don't know how the process works or what their plans are for that.
But I definitely let him know that he's,
he wanted a cell phone and that he was getting agitated and that you spoke with your
daughter right he wants a cell phone okay all right well all right thank you
