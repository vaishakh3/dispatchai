I don't really know where I'm at.
But one of my customers just got robbed and he got shot.
Okay.
Find out where you are, hon.
Yeah, I'm on 62.
It's Morris Avenue, or Morris Street.
Are you in Giff County?

What's your name, hon?
Call for me, okay.
Please hurry up.
They call me.
They'll call me.
Do you know why they're chasing you, hon?
Well, he's got a bunch of nice cars in the driveway,
and they just walked up and pulled a gun and said that they want the money.
Okay.
And Dan told him, he said, it's Van Yates.
He said, I don't have no money.
And they kept on, they told him, he said, you think I'm playing around, I'm not.
And they just shot him.
Okay.
Listen to me, sweetie.
What business is this at?
It's not a business.
house.
It's the second house on the right when you pull on Morse.
Oh, Morris?
Okay.
Yes, ma'am.
All right.
What are they wearing, huh?
What are they wearing?
Black pants and gray hoodies.
Okay.
Please hurry.
Now, I'm going to keep you on the farm until they get there, okay.
Well, please hurry up.
They're coming.
They're coming to them.
They're coming in as far as they can, okay.
Oh, my God.
You said they're wearing black pants and what else?
And gray sweatshirts.
And gray sweatshirts?
Okay.
Yes, ma'am.
Listen to me, sweetie, okay.
You're doing good, all right?
Oh, my God.
I can't believe this.
It's freaking broad daylight.
I mean, they just came up and shot him.
Oh, man.
All right.
Today of time.
Tell me, please tell the cops, but I'm back here in the woods hiding.
I've got a orange shirt or a green shirt.
Okay.
I need you to stay on the phone with me until they get there, and I'm letting them know.
I'm updating them as you talk to me, okay?
Well, I'm in the woods.
I've got a green shirt and tan pants on.
Okay.
Tell them not shoot me.
Okay.
As Dan, he's on the back porch.
I'll please hurry up.
Well, they're coming as fast as they can, hon.
They got the drive.
Where was your friend at when he was shot?
Where exactly was he at the house?
On the back porch.
We were just sitting out there talking.
And these two black males walked up.
And I've got my truck sitting outside.
And they said, do you have any lawnmowers for sale?
We were like, no.
And they asked them, what are y'all doing here anyway?
What do you all want?
Uh-huh.
And they pull the guns.
Okay.
And just asked, and said, where's the motherfucking money at?
Okay.
And Van told him, he said, man, I ain't got no money on you.
Okay.
Oh my gosh.
Please hurry up.
I don't want to go up there and check on Van, but I'm going to like up.
No, no, no.
I'll meet you to stay where you are.
Your friend's name is Vance?
Van Yates.
Van Yates.
Van Yates?
Okay.
Yes, man.
I don't even hear no cops.
Where are they at?
Well, you know, they got the drive there.
Oh, my God.
You just remain calm, okay?
I hope he's not dead.
Oh, my God.
Hold is your friend.
He's probably like in mid-50s.
50s, okay.
And he's shot right in the chest, point-blank.
Oh, my God.
You see a wait?
I don't know.
Okay, that's fine.
That's fine.
But they shot him right in the chest.
Okay.
Well, Van, he's got guns in the house and...
He does.
Yeah, he took home moving around, and he told the guy, he said,
hold on, I got money in the house.
And I know, Van, he's got guns in the house, and I know what he's going to do.
He's going to go on there and get a gun.
Okay.
And as soon as he opened up the screen door, the goose shot him.
Okay.
Please hurry up.
And he doesn't see him off.
Is that in the driveway?
No, it's sitting in front of the house.
Okay.
There's a white Chevrolet.
Is your truck there?
Well, there's one sitting in the road.
Okay.
one sitting in the driveway.
Okay.
Now, the one that's in the driveway, whose vehicle is that?
Is that vans?
Yes, man.
That's vans.
I don't know if these guys pulled up or if they go if they...
I'll let you know when you can come out.
In the meantime, I want you to stay where you are, okay?
Oh, my God.
Well, I'm like a dagon sitting duck here with his green shirt on.
I mean, everybody and the brother can see me in the woods.
Please hurry up.
Yeah, everybody, I know Vannes probably did.
Okay.
Oh, my God.
Why did this have to happen?
I don't know.
The Vand's one of the best people in the world.
He's one of the best people I've got.
And the dude's just fucking shot him.
Okay.
Are y'all showing?
Why were they trying to rob him?
Oh, I'm guessing it's just because he's got nice cars sitting in the driveway, and they've seen the cars, and I don't know.
Oh, my God.
Please hurry up. I know all his family.
I don't know his family, and they're going to be bad to me if he ends up dying.
Please hurry up.
Oh, my God.
I know his freaking child.
I want to go up there and check on him, but I'm freaking scared.
I just want you to stay where you are, okay.
Well, where's the cops going to?
I haven't seen the cops.
I already know where you are.
You just stay where you are.
Don't worry about all of that, okay?
Are they here?
Is the cops here?
No, I tell you when to leave where you are.
In the meantime, stay where you are, okay?
They come in as fast as they can.
They have to drive there.
Oh, my God. What's this freaking world coming to?
This is crazy.
I don't understand it.
Mine in the world to be cheating.
My God.
You know where they're at?
Ma'am.
No.
Alright, here's sirens, man.
Don't go out until I tell you.
Okay.
Well, there's a big, there's a barn back here in the back corner of his lot.
I'm back here behind the barn.
Okay.
I'll let go with him and let them know.
You stay there, okay?
Okay.
Don't move.
Don't move.
Stay there.
Yeah, why is it taking so long?
He's going to be freaking dead.
You stay there until I tell you to come out, okay?
All right.
Have they got their ambulance coming?
Of course.
I have the ambulance, police, and fire.
We're worried up.
Oh, my gosh.
I hope he don't die.
Oh, my God.
Well, right now we try and find out where these suspects are with the guns,
and they're going to do no good if they shoot my people.
Oh, I understand. I understand, ma'am.
All right. So that, so we're working with that right now.
I didn't see if they left or what.
Exactly.
Whenever they shot van, I just took off running.
Right, which I understand that.
But right now I can't send in my rescue people until we know where they are,
because I don't want my people shot either.
All right.
So the police, the sheriff's department is on the way,
and trying to figure out
where to the suspects are.
I've seen the Archdale Police Department
coming down the road.
Okay.
Well, I want you to stay where you are
until I tell you to come out, okay?
Oh, my God.
Doing good.
You're doing good.
I was going to shoot me in the back
when I was running.
Yeah.
Well, you did the right thing, okay?
Because if you would have got hurt,
we would have never known
neither one of you would have been.
You understand?
You see what I'm saying?
Yes, ma'am.
Oh, I hear the Sheriff's Department up there now.
Just let me know whenever they come out.
I will.
I'll let them know, okay?
You stay where you are.
All right.
Man, I hope that's not dead.
Golly.
Why?
Were those guys in the car, anything?
I don't know, ma'am.
I don't know.
They just, we were sitting on.
the back porch and I've seen the shadow up against the wall.
Okay.
And they just, I've seen them walk in.
I didn't hear no car pull up or anything.
Okay.
Oh man, I just knew I was going to get shot.
I can't believe they shot van.
Is the ambulance here yet?
I'm not sitting in my ambulance in until we find out where these suspects are.
Okay.
Oh, they're close by though?
Yeah, they're close by.
You just ain't tight until I tell you to come out.
I can't believe this.
Are they found van yet?
I don't know, hon.
Oh my gosh.
I got a bunch of police units coming, including Archdale and the Sheriff Department.
Okay.
Is that for all right?
Oh, it does say come in?
No, man, we've got to be dead.
Well, our sheriff's department is there,
and they're telling the EMS people to come on in.
Hold on a minute, and I'll let you know when you can come in, okay?
All right.
You don't have anything on you, do you?
No, I don't have nothing.
No, no weapons or anything to that nature.
No, man.
I'll come out the woods with my hands up.
I'm just telling them all.
I'm back here behind the barn.
Okay.
All right, hold tight.
Oh, my gosh.
I got 10.
I can't, I don't mind.
Just freaking blessed that it should be.
Yeah, hold on.
Just on, okay?
Let them get your friend situated, let them try to find out where these suspects are,
and then they'll tell you to come.
come out, okay?
Okay.
I hear the ambulance coming out.
Yeah.
Well, they're there.
The ambulance is there along with the fire department and the sheriff's department, but they
need to get some stuff straight now.
I don't know yet, I don't know, hon, because I'm not out there.
