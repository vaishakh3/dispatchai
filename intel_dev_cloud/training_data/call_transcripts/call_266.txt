9-1-1, how can I help you?
Hello?
911, how can I help you?
Somebody just broke with our door trying to break into my bedroom.
What's your address?
3719, North East 64th Avenue.
How long ago?
How long ago?
About 20 seconds ago.
Is he still in the house?
I don't know. I'm playing a gun at the door in case someone comes through it.
How did they try and get in?
I don't know. I was asleep. My dog started barking.
Okay, you said someone tried to break into your house, sir. I need you to be a little...
Okay, through what door, window, where?
Do you, what do you hear going on, sir?
He's trying to break through my door.
Is he still outside now?
He's in my house trying to break into my bedroom.
Do you know who it is?
No, I don't.
Okay.
My partner's getting help.
Listen to me.
Listen to me.
My partner's getting officers on the way.
Stay calm and stay in the room, okay?
All right.
He's trying to kick the door in.
Okay.
Tell him that cops are on the way he needs to leave.
Tell him, cops are on the way you need to leave.
I got to shut him about six times.
You walk, you move.
Tell him, cops are on the way, get out of my house.
What type of gun are you armed with?
I've armed with 22.
22 caliber rifle?
22 caliber handguns.
And you have no idea who it is, correct?
I've never seen this guy before my life.
Do you have...
It was on my bedroom floor bleeding all over.
Okay.
Better send an ambulance.
Is he inside your bedroom floor now?
He's got damn right here.
He's laying down here.
Okay.
Did you shoot him?
I sure as all did.
He charged at me and my wife.
Okay.
Where did you shoot him at, sir?
Pardon me?
Where did you shoot him at?
Body mask.
Okay, we're getting medical started as well.
Is he still conscious?
I don't know.
I'm not going near him because he's kicking him
way a little bit and he just stopped.
Is your front door unlocked, sir?
I don't know.
Can you have your wife go unlock the front door?
I need you to...
He's...
He's down. He's not moving. I want the weapon secured.
No problem.
In the house, Robert.
My wife, my dog, and myself.
Okay. After the front door is unlocked, go lock up the dog.
My wife is just the front door now.
I want the dog locked up. I want the dog secured in a kennel or in a room.
Just a minute.
Okay, actually, Robert, I want you and the wife.
Where did you secure the weapon at?
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.
Where's your handgun?
It's in the kitchen here, and he's in my bedroom.
Okay.
Okay, Robert?
Yes.
Unload your gun.
It's unloaded, and the chamber is empty.
Unloaded chamber is empty. We're going to go outside.
You, the wife, leave the dog inside.
Hopefully he's locked up.
My wife is trying to lock the dog up now.
If we...
Lock her in our...
...in the office, yeah.
Okay.
Please come.
The officers are already outside, but we're going to...
Let's just...
Let's leave the dog where he is, okay, Robert.
All right.
We'll leave him be...
Leave...
Leave...
You have the gun, correct.
No, it's laying on my kitchen tape.
No, we're going to take the gun outside because of the suspect.
So we're taking that outside, but we want it unloaded.
You don't want...
I want you to hold it by the barrel.
I have a bad barrel.
I want you to keep the butt facing away from you.
So the gun is backward.
You're going to walk out with your hands in the air.
The officers know you're going to meet them outside.
Okay.
Are you outside?
I am.
Okay.
Do you see my officers?
I am.
Do you see my officers?
All right.
They're going to start giving you voice commands.
I'm going to let you go.
Listen to them.
I'm sorry?
I'm very hard in hearing.
Okay.
I don't have my hearing aids then.
What?
Is the wife still with you, Robert?
They just drove by me.
Stop.
Stop walking. Stand at your front door.
Four of them.
Stop walking. Stand at...
Hey guys.
Robert, did your wife go outside with you?
I'm outside, but they're way down the block.
Right. Is your wife outside with you?
Is my wife out with me?
Yes, sir. Is she outside?
She just walked out the door.
Okay.
Okay, both of you just stand there.
Wait for the officers to give you further instructions.
I'm going to let you touch my wife because I...
Okay.
Ma'am, the officers are going to start giving you instructions.
Where are you at outside?
We're standing in our driveway.
You know, it makes me nervous to leave that man.
It's in there laying on the floor.
That's why we took the gun with us.
Were there any other guns in the bedroom that he would have access to?
Bob, are there any other guns in the bedroom?
Okay.
Put it on the ground, Bob.
Okay.
Walk to him.
Now I'm going to let you go.
Follow the officer's commands.
Okay.
Goodbye.
