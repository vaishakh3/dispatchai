Can you push her over?
No, she's too big.
But are you a doctor or?
No, but honey, I am going to get someone out to you.
I want you to stand the phone with me.
How long has your mommy been sleeping?
I don't know.
She just said like this. I was trying to get off and the baby is crying. I don't know how to make, um, uh, if she, I was calling somebody to Dr. Dave, what to answer.
Okay. So she's been like that for a couple hours? Yeah. Is that your baby brother or sister?
Yeah. I can't make him a bottle. I don't know how I just did. Okay, you can't make him a bottle. How old is your brother or sister?

Okay, okay, you're doing great.
Is your baby brother in, like, a little sling, or is he laying in a crib, or...
No, he's with, um, Raleigh and he's little hair.
And his little chair does his little pet tiggle?
What?
Like, this is a little scary? Is it a bouncy chair?
He's on me as fast, but it was what...
I was telling him to wake up and I'm so tired. I'm afraid and we stay up all night.

Does he have something that he wants to, like, put in his mouth?
Does he have a housefire or binkie?
Um, can you come out and show you what the bottle looks like?
Because my mom's waiting on before I don't, she's not waking up somehow.
Okay, that's fine.
You can take your phone with me.
Tell me what the bottle looks like.
It has stuff in it, but it has the stuff in it.
It has the formia.
And I was shaking it up in it.
Somehow it didn't go way close to.
Is there water in the bottle with the formula?
Yeah, you have to put it in.
That's how you make it.
You are very smart.
That is how we make bottles.
Did you twist the top one all the way?
Yeah.
And I was shaking it and put it to make milk and it
It's okay.
It's okay.
You have to take it a little longer.
If it's twisted on, right, with the little eating part you suck out of, we can take it again together.
We'll take together.
Okay.

No, I don't have it right now.
Can you take the phone with you?
We want to try and help baby off it or baby out.

But I can't bring the whole phone.
Okay, okay, can you set the phone down and go get the bottle and come back?
Okay.
Okay, I'm back.

Okay, I'm still here, honey.
Did we take the model?
Yeah, I have it.
Okay, does it look more like formula now?
Um, no, there's the formula on the bottom and it's closed it up.
Okay, well let's take it really hard.
Okay.
I'm shaking it.
You are doing good.
Sometimes the formula likes to get stuck.
I was watching a movie and somehow I told her she'd get up and she was doing them.
She did this, I think three or two are times already.
I don't know.

You're doing so good.
I'm so proud of you.
I'm sure your mommy is proud of you too.

Okay. If you put your hand in front of her nose or her mouth, can you feel any breath?
Okay, I want to do that. You don't want to do that?
Well, no, what?
Can you put your hand in front of her mouth? Do you know how you feel if you're breathing?
Yeah.
Do you feel any of that air from your mommy?
I don't know. I didn't do yet. Hold on.
Okay.
I don't know because there's new thrown in it.
And I don't know if she's bringing her by.
I don't know she's going for her.

How's that bottle looking?
It still has formula to water.

Because I'm trying to make him one and he's out and I can't.
Okay, that's all right.
If we took it up, does it have enough liquid so he can get some liquid to maybe help him?
I think my mom put too much and that's why I can't work in, I think.
