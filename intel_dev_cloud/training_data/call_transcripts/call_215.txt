Um, all you're doctors, because my mom's on the four, we think I can't wake her up.
How old is your mommy?
Um, I don't know, but she's not waking up.
I always trying to wake her up and the baby crying.
I was crying my head off.
Okay, can you give me a favor, sweet?
Is your mom in her stomach or her back?
I don't know.
When you look at your mommy, you're laying on her stomach?
Okay.
Well, we're right back.
So it's her on her back, see?
She's laying on her side.
Okay, can you roll her flat on her back?
Can you push her over?
No, she's too big.
But are you a doctor or?
No, but honey, I am going to get someone out to you.
I want you to stand the phone with me.
How long has your mommy been sleeping?
I don't know.
She just said like this. I was trying to get off and the baby is crying. I don't know how to make, um, uh, if she, I was calling somebody to Dr. Dave, what to answer.
Okay. So she's been like that for a couple hours? Yeah. Is that your baby brother or sister?
Yeah. I can't make him a bottle. I don't know how I just did. Okay, you can't make him a bottle. How old is your brother or sister?
Oh, my sister's not here.
She's at my desk and in the baby's two weeks old, my mom.
The baby's two weeks old?
Yeah.
Okay, sweetie.
Is there any, what's the bottle look like?
Do you know where the bottles are?
I know what one bottle is because, can you really hear me because the baby's crying.
I can hear you, sweetie.
I can hear you really good.
You're doing a great job.
Does your baby brother take a baby or a pacifier?
Oh, we have cereal for him and...
I'll try and make the cereal, honey.
I don't know how it's not open the box.
Okay, okay, you're doing great.
Is your baby brother in, like, a little sling, or is he laying in a crib, or...
No, he's with, um, Raleigh and he's little hair.
And his little chair does his little pet tiggle?
What?
Like, this is a little scary? Is it a bouncy chair?
He's on me as fast, but it was what...
I was telling him to wake up and I'm so tired. I'm afraid and we stay up all night.
Oh, honey, you're not going to stay up all night. We're going to get someone to help you.
You're being so brave right now. I'm so proud of you. How old are you?
Five. Five. You are doing great. What's your name? Austin.

Do you like your new baby brother?
Yes.
What's his name?
Um, form.
His name is Aiden.
Baby Aiden?
Yeah.
Can we talk to baby Aiden?
Does he have something that he wants to, like, put in his mouth?
Does he have a housefire or binkie?
Um, can you come out and show you what the bottle looks like?
Because my mom's waiting on before I don't, she's not waking up somehow.
Okay, that's fine.
You can take your phone with me.
Tell me what the bottle looks like.
It has stuff in it, but it has the stuff in it.
It has the formia.
And I was shaking it up in it.
Somehow it didn't go way close to.
Is there water in the bottle with the formula?
Yeah, you have to put it in.
That's how you make it.
You are very smart.
That is how we make bottles.
Did you twist the top one all the way?
Yeah.
And I was shaking it and put it to make milk and it
It's okay.
It's okay.
You have to take it a little longer.
If it's twisted on, right, with the little eating part you suck out of, we can take it again together.
We'll take together.
Okay.
Okay.
You shaking it out?
No, I don't have it right now.
Can you take the phone with you?
We want to try and help baby off it or baby out.
Aiden.
This is a phone.
This is our house phone.
But I can't bring the whole phone.
Okay, okay, can you set the phone down and go get the bottle and come back?
Okay.
Okay, I'm back.
I'm back.
Okay, I'm still here, honey.
Did we take the model?
Yeah, I have it.
Okay, does it look more like formula now?
Um, no, there's the formula on the bottom and it's closed it up.
Okay, well let's take it really hard.
Okay.
I'm shaking it.
You are doing good.
Sometimes the formula likes to get stuck.
I was watching a movie and somehow I told her she'd get up and she was doing them.
She did this, I think three or two are times already.
I don't know.
I don't know.
You're doing so good.
I'm so proud of you.
I'm sure your mommy is proud of you too.

Okay. If you put your hand in front of her nose or her mouth, can you feel any breath?
Okay, I want to do that. You don't want to do that?
Well, no, what?
Can you put your hand in front of her mouth? Do you know how you feel if you're breathing?
Yeah.
Do you feel any of that air from your mommy?
I don't know. I didn't do yet. Hold on.
Okay.
I don't know because there's new thrown in it.
And I don't know if she's bringing her by.
I don't know she's going for her.
Okay.
Does she have any red stuff by her body?
No.
No blood?
Do you know what blood looks like?
I know it's red.
Okay.
You don't see any of that?
No.

How's that bottle looking?
It still has formula to water.
I'll try to get you when you get you come.
Because I'm trying to make him one and he's out and I can't.
Okay, that's all right.
If we took it up, does it have enough liquid so he can get some liquid to maybe help him?
I think my mom put too much and that's why I can't work in, I think.
Oh, okay.
