Number one with the other three emergency.
My girlfriend is rape and I think she's dead.
I need someone here now.
Okay. Is she breathing?
No, she ain't. There's vomit. She's been beat.
There's something tied around her neck. I just cut it off. She's dead.
I've been doing CPR for the past 20 minutes. She ain't coming back.
What's your address?
I'm at...
Yes, it's called Cambridge Square. The complex.
Someone said they already called ambulance, but I'm just making sure.
Who called the ambulance?
My neighbors.
Okay, we don't have a call on it. You said you've been doing CPR?
Yeah. Get someone down here right now before I kill them.
They're on their way, okay?
Because I think my neighbor did it.
I've got the other dispatcher discharging them at this time.
Do you want to continue to try to do CPR?
Are?
Yes.
Tell me what I need to do.
All right.
Okay.
Are you there?
Yes.
Okay.
You're going to take your hands and you're going to place them.
She's on the floor.
She's on the floor, right?
Yes.
Okay.
You're going to put your hand in the center of her chest right between the nipples.
All right.
Okay.
Yes.
Push down hard and fast, two inches in depth.
Okay, and you're going to try to pump twice every second.
It's going to be about 100 compressions a minute.
It's going to be very quickly paced, okay?
Say that again.
It's going to be very quickly paced.
You're going to want to do about 100 compressions per minute, okay?
I'm sorry?
Do it 100 pounds?
Like, put down on chest, a hundred times?
That's what you're saying?
Keep doing that.
I do 30 of them, okay?
One, two, three, four, four.
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 5, 1,000, 2,000, 2,000, 2,000, 20.
Okay, when you do 30, you're going to need to tilt her head back and give her two breaths.
Okay, then do 30 more compression.
It's not like air's coming out, but I think it's just, keep doing it.
Keep doing it.
30 more compression.
And give her two more friends.
And then go back to 30 more complex.
And then go back to 30 more complex.
One compress.
Two more breaths.
There you go.
Come on, Dave.
Another, 30 more compression.
More compression.
More compresses.
I can't leave it.
I can't leave it.
Two more breath.
Yes.
Damn it.
There you.
There you go.
There you go.
There you go.
30 more compression.
30 more compression.
Keep going.
Keep going.
Just sounds like she's choking when it will bomb it.
I can tell she's vomited.
She breathes all around the neck.
She looks like to take this color.
I don't feel a pulse.
Okay, keep doing impressions.
The God, please.
I'm going to get to 30.
We'll get the 30.
Get her three breasts again.
This is 9-1-1-1.
I got disconnected from you.
Sorry.
That's okay.
Are you still doing the compression?
Yes.
Come here.
My girlfriend's been breaking.
She's dead.
Sir, are you still doing the CPR?
Yes, I'm doing CPR.
Okay.
Who's there with you?
My neighbor.
Okay.
Come on, baby.
Oh, God.
You're just right, okay?
Oh, no, but I can't want to put on the facade.
Give it her the two breath.
Give it her the two breaths.
There you go.
Come on, baby.
Take the phone and talk to this lady.
Help her, help her, man.
