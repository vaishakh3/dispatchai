Name 1-1-1. What's the address of your emergency?
Apartment.
Your, my name is collapsed on the floor.
Okay, and the phone number you're calling from me.
You'll need to know my name is to get in our door.
I'm going to start getting him out of the mouth. He's turning black.
Ma'am, stay on the line with me. Are you with him now?
Yes, right next to me.
He's rigid.
How old is he?
Sixty-one and perfect...
Two-62 in perfect health.
Okay.
He fell off the chair.
He said, ow.
Is he conscious?
No, he's not.
I need to roll him over.
Is he breathing?
Barely.
His tongue is swelling.
He may be a seizure.
You hear him?
Yes, I do.
Can I try to...
Don't hang up.
Stand alive.
You guys are getting glassy.
Please let me give him out the mouth.
We're going to get...
We're going to get him some help.
Did you see what happened?
No, yes.
He was just sitting there.
to me. On the chair, drinking his coffee, and he said, oh, and he fell forward.
Did he choke on anything first?
No. Drinking, he had drunk his coffee three years. Please, he's getting very dark.
Okay, is there a defibrillator available? No. I'm going to have to, please.
Okay, I'm sending the paramedics to help you now. Stand the line and I'll say exactly what to do next.
Are you right by him now?
Yes, listen, the hardest thing is going to be getting him through the door,
someone to get him from the door downstairs.
Listen carefully, Mrs. Ply him flat on his back on the ground and remove any pillows.
Okay, there's not.
Okay, is he flat on his back on the ground?
Yes, but he's not breathing.
Kneel next to him and look in his mouth for food or vomit.
There is nothing. He's eaten nothing.
Okay, place your hand on his forehead, your other hand under his neck, and tilt the head back.
Okay.
Okay, put your ear next to his mouth.
There's nothing.
Okay.
God, let me pray from him.
Bring him back.
Keep going, doctor, please.
Okay, listen carefully.
I'll tell you how to do chest compressions.
Go ahead.
Make sure he's flat on his back.
Place the heel of your hand on the breastbone
in the center of his chest right between the nipples.
Put your other hand on top of that.
Yes.
With only the heel of your lower hand touching the chest.
Yes.
Okay, listen carefully.
I want you to pump the chest hard and fast.
How often?
About two, twice per second.
Okay, one, two, okay, okay.
Okay, you just keep going with that.
I'm, it's going to pump 400 times.
That's fine.
I'm trying to heal.
Dear God, bring him back to life.
Keep talking.
Okay.
You just keep pumping that chest, hard and fast.
Hard and fast.
Go ahead.
Honey, come on.
Breathe.
Dear God, heal him.
Heal him, dear God.
Dear God, I ask you to.
Let the chest come all the way up in between pumps, Mrs.
Okay.
How often did I do this?
You want to do it hard and fast at least twice per second.
Okay, I'm doing it.
Okay, let the chest come all the way up between pumps.
Yes, how close did I be to the stomach?
On it, or you used to between his nipples.
Got it.
Yep, between his nipples.
Got it.
Come on.
You're doing great.
We're going to keep doing this until we've done 400 compression.
Three and a half minutes.
There's a couple breathing now.
Come on.
Breathe.
I'm going.
Good, good.
There's so, honey.
You're going,
Eddie.
Keep talking.
Would you help him with me?
Yes, I will.
Just pray.
As a born-again Christian,
we know he's going to heaven,
but I would like him with me a little longer than this.
Okay, and that's what we're going to do.
God bring him back to your glory, dear God.
This is to glorify you.
Go ahead.
Okay.
Is he...
The lemon's starting to come out of his mouth.
Okay, good.
Because I get his head back to...
Turn his...
Turn his head.
If something's starting to come out of his mouth, you need to turn his head to the side and clean out his mouth.
Okay, it's just slam.
Okay.
His eyes are open, but he's not as well.
You can hear him breathing.
Okay.
Keep those compressions going hard and fast.
Would they be able to get in the door?
Yes, they will.
When you were here a few weeks ago, they couldn't.
They'll get in the door.
Is your front door unlocked?
No, but I'm about 20 feet from.
I just don't want to stop right now.
Okay.
Nope.
I don't want you to stop right now.
right now. I don't want you to stop until we hear somebody at the door.
Okay. Thank you for this by the way.
You're doing a great job. My name is Julie.
Okay, Julie. Okay, I'm going to just say you.
I will glorify the king of king. I will glorify the lamb.
I will glorify the king, king, who is the great I am.
Hallelujah to the king of king.
Alleluia to the lamb
To the king of king
He is the great
God, please
God breathe
God breathe
God, I asked it
Is he'll come out of his mouth
No, how are they not
No, okay
He is breathing
But he's making you, can you hear him?
I can hear him
What does it sound like to you?
It sounds like agonal breathing to me
What is that?
It sounds like
Oh, okay, I'm sorry, you sound a heart attack to you?
If it is, let me tell you.
He runs 10 and 11 miles a day.
He saw the doctor a month ago and told him,
don't bother coming in, you're so healthy, you know, like for the next two years.
Okay.
This is a man of extreme health, but you hear this.
Are you coming to?
Can you hear me?
Okay.
You have chest pain.
What is it causing this?
Honey, what's causing it?
Do you know?
His color's coming back.
Okay, good, good, good.
He's got a little bit of red blue pick blend on his forehead when I think he fell on the rug.
Okay.
Can you tell me what it is?
No.
Can you move your arms, honey?
Move your arm.
Can you?
Okay, move both arms.
Show me you can move your arm up, left arm down, move your right arm.
Move this arm, honey.
Move this arm, can you?
No.
He cannot move his right arm.
Okay, but he's responding to you, Mrs.
He's starting, but he's talking, but I'm still working on it.
Okay, good, good.
You just keep going.
Okay, move an arm.
Move this up.
Move your right arm.
Come on, honey.
Will they be getting here soon?
Yes, they will.
Can you breathe, honey?
Honey, what's my name?
Do you love me?
Yeah.
Let me hear you pray.
Do you know what it is?
No, I don't know.
Honey, you said, ow, and you fell.
Was it a headache?
They're here.
May I run to the door?
Julie?
Yes.
Okay.
Are you here?
Okay, run and open the door.
Honey, they're coming.
I'm going to, if they won't let me go in the ambulance with you, I'll be there.
Listen to Kuku.
Yeah.
I love you.
You're going to go to heaven.
You know where to meet me, right?
Yeah.
And you're going to try to stay around for me?
Yeah.
I'm glad you're not fishing.
Is he a fisherman?
Oh, two hours a day.
Oh, four hours in the morning and the evening.
I love you.
Can you move your legs at all?
Let me see you move your legs.
You can't, honey?
Did you have any head pain?
No.
Hey, Lucie.
You're the best.
I love you too, honey.
Just keep it up.
I thought he was playing with me at first when he fell over.
And I, five seconds, I said, oh, yeah, I'm going to call him 911 if you don't get up.
This is what I hang up.
They're probably trying to call me.
See, they can't get in with these.
Go open the front.
Go open your door.
Okay, one minute.
Go open your door.
You can't believe you, okay?
Ma'am?
Yes, Mr.
You get it.
I see the vehicles.
I hear nobody come out.
Maybe they're coming now.
They're coming up.
They're coming up.
They had to grab their equipment.
Okay.
And they're coming up.
You've done a fantastic job for him.
God allows these to happen to glorify him.
What about me now for heaven or not?
Understand.
He's there with you now.
No, they're not.
You mean God is, yes, I'm sorry.
Oh, he's here.
Honey, you okay?
Keep talking to me.
Yeah.
You're getting close.
You just tell them to hang in there.
They're telling you to hang in there.
Ma'am, are you in communication with them?
Do you know that they're coming through the door?
Yes, I do.
Okay.
Come on in.
Come on in.
They're there with you now?
Okay, Mrs.
They're going to take good care of him.
God bless you too.
God bless you too.
