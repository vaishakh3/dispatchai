They're pulling this road over here.
They got put in piles and piles of this shit.
Roll the further up over there, though.
I don't think it's tough, too.
Don't think it's a little bit right here.
They said that's two.
Okay, go ahead.
Let's go down here to the end of the road and come back to the room.
I'm going to fucking sleep up, though.
Truck is going to put it up.
Can you doing that, though?
I'll fucking want myself up.
All right.
If I had a hill dog, I could lift that big copper minute.
A thousand pounds there, one spot.
A $1,000.
A $7,000.
A piece of a little bit more than $1.00.
They don't have anything.
It's in the middle of the night, dog.
I walk some fucking footcutters up at somewhere else.
Don't you know so much.
I find me no six months.
Okay?
See the same?
I'll tell you.
I'm going to do to pop some time.
Okay.
Tom, let's look it in the top of course, kid.
Go this way, we'll go back around that way like you go.
I got some of the time to do some more around here.
Oh, healing.
You know, you're a kid with the way?
There's something that you'll get you run around there.
It should be.
Ever I thought I'd be in a fucking air force,
so I was fucking in a big.
I didn't have Randy. I didn't have Randy out there. Those people are awake and that
the hills are moving around, you know what I mean? Why? Yeah, they're eating. I couldn't have Randy
I take it. But this motherfucker trip out, though. Yeah, we'll go back up in the morning.
I went there to throw one of their drinks out of the cooler, dog. They've got a cool
a cooler before? I don't know. I don't care, Jack, one of the drinks out of the cooler.
He just walked out. He's got one. He just walked out. He's got one.
That's all me.
That's right.
Welcome to every one in the tank.
That might be $200.
We'll get over here.
You've got three hard, so you can shoot out, huh?
Yep.
Oh, $3.00 to $100,000, dude.
$100,000.
Oh, $100,000.
Okay.
Yeah.
That's just a job.
That's a little amount.
You got $10.
Before you get you that price,
like you walk that old?
Yeah.
Yeah.
You're done.
Okay.
I don't know how to put it in the other hand back.
I don't say, I'm going to,
it's just the fucking what is that?
What is that?
Yeah, I'm going to be able to take a shit out and blow up.
How are you going to be going to take shit?
See that?
Bill's lit up there up there?
There's a driveway right before.
I want you to pull in that.
The motherfucker can't kill it.
So we got a fucking tall-ass one,
that.

Yeah, right there.
Right here, right, right.
Pull in there and just bring it out.
We're right to me.
Get it up.

This is all.
Oh.
Go ahead.
Got in.
I don't know what you're going to have to be able to get away.
Okay, you turn around here.
Yeah, well, though.
No, you have to get west to that road.
Okay, you turn around here.

Don't want to fuck with him?
Yeah, I'm probably 55.
You don't know.
