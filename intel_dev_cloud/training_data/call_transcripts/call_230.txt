and put it back in the gun
locker

she sick was? She has
dementia real bad
and
and she got to be a wicked person.
Okay.
And where did you shoot her?

Well, she was on a couch and I saw her probably in the stomach area.
And you said twice?
Yeah, I saw her twice.
Okay.
And what did you shoot her?

A 12-gave-shall gun.
Okay.
Okay, and you said, what was your first name?
Christopher.
Christopher, okay.
And are you inside the house still?
Well, yeah, I'm sitting on the back porch because I just wanted to do this.
Okay.
Okay. I'm going to put you on hold for just one moment. Don't hang up.
Okay. I'm going to stay on the phone with you, Christopher, until they get there, just so you have somebody to talk to you, okay?
Would you do me, favor?
What's up?
Don't tell them they come up here with light sirens, because I don't want me to keep people to know what he's doing it.
He's asking for a silent approach from everybody because he doesn't want everybody to know what he's done.
Okay, and Christopher, do you find that you're your first name, whether K or a CH?
Oh, C.H like Thomas.
Okay.
Okay.
I don't want to do this.
Just tell me guys when it comes.
I'm not crazy.
Okay.
Take a deep breath.
I let them know what you've requested, okay?
Okay.
They had to come up the doctor for.
I was sending out on the backports.
Okay.
So I can't know.
Just quick and miss for 37 years.
I'm like to do this.
I'm not going to hurt no one when you come up there.
Yes, he put it away, broke it back down, put in the gun case.
I want to do this.
Yeah, and he's on the back porch waiting for them.
I'm highly upset.
I'm sorry.
That's okay.
It's all right.
Understandable why you're upset.
I didn't want to see this because I can't see this no more.
I can't see this no more.
There's just a, just a boy.
I don't hear me.
I don't know how I didn't want to do that.
And he was all cursing in her head and had to do it.
God, don't hurt me when you come out.
I heard it now.
Okay.
Just, I'm going to tell you what, because you did shoot your wife,
there are several officers coming in first,
and they're going to make contact with you,
and they may have their guns drawn,
make sure that you don't make any sudden moves
and that you're very open.
Okay.
Okay, and be very open with them as you have been with me.
Okay, and then the medics are going to come in and confirm, okay?
Okay, but just stay on the phone with me until they get there.
All right.
I thought.
My heart is starting now.
I should have shot myself, too.
Oh, no.
Okay, well, all I can say is try to take a deep breath and relax.
I know this is a very stressful time for you right now.
It's not all what you expected.
Don't hurt me, Monica.
Don't hurt her. I've already hurt her now.
Oh, so good.
