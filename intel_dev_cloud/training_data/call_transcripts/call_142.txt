None and one. What is the address of the emergency?
Hi, this is Terry.
I live in Mount Prospect, but I need to have somebody go to my brother-in-law's house.
Okay, what is his...
Okay, what is his address, Terry?
Hang on a second.
My brother-in-law's girlfriend just ran away from the house.
I don't have the address memorized, but I have it here.
Hang on a second.

Okay, in the address, we're sure it's 531 Wilshire.
Yes.
I don't show that a good Arlington Heights address.
Okay, hang on.
I'm just leaping through my address book right now.
Okay.
That's okay.
Nancy, stay there.
Don't go in the house.
Okay.
It's 1031.
I'm sorry.
It's 103.
I had the cops on the line now, honey.
Okay, 1031 North Wiltshire Lane in Arlington Heights.
And he's leaving right now.
No, he's leaving right now.
Okay, ma'am, hang on just, Terry, calm down just a moment, please.
I just want to make sure, is it 1031 North Wiltshire Lane in Arlington Heights?
Yes.
Okay, and Terry, what's going on out there?
Well, my brother-in-law's girlfriend received a call from work
and that my brother-in-law hasn't shown up.
She went in there.
My nephew, who's had drug issues, wouldn't let her in the beginning,
but she went in there, and she said that my brother-in-law,
My mother-in-law is dead.
Okay, how old is he?
He's 18 years old, I think, or 19.
Okay, is he awake?
She said that he's pulling out of the house right now.
Okay, so did he get up and leave, or what are you saying?
He's dead?
No, no, my nephew is in the house and we think he's the one that did it.
Okay, so there's someone, okay, there's someone.
Someone down in the house and a second male left the house?
Do you think he killed him or?
Yes, yes, please.
Okay, hang on just a second.
I'm getting help on the way.
Hang on just a second.
Stay on the phone with me, Terry.
I'll be right back with you.
8.43am. 43 seconds.
April 14, 2011.
Terry?
Yeah.
Okay, Viva.
Okay, Viva.
Terry, we have the police and paramedics on the way right now.
So who is the person that fled the house?
That's my nephew, Matthew.
No is him, and he's a drug person.
Okay.
Does the lady that's there right now, can she tell us if this person is awake or if he's breathing?
You mean my brother-in-law.
Okay, it's your brother-in-law at the house?
Okay, there were two people in the house.
One is my brother-in-law who has been missing from work,
And the other one is my nephew, Matthew, who has drug issues.
And the person who is on the phone would be right now is my brother-in-law's girlfriend.
Okay, so the girlfriend found him in the house and the nephew took off then.
Is that right?
I am with 911, Nancy.
I am there on the way.
Okay, ma'am, the nephew took off.
Is that right?
Hang on, Nancy.
What is it?
Hello?
Ma'am, are you talking, ma'am, please talk to me.
Hang on just a second.
Yep, they're coming, ma'am.
Can they tell you at all why do they think he's dead?
Is there an outward sign of any trauma or what's going on?
She's on speakerphone.
I don't know if you could hear it.
Nancy, can you say how you found George, please?
Did you hear that, ma'am?
No, I didn't, ma'am.
He's what now in the basement?
He's in the basement tied to a chair, not...
Okay.
So he was found tied to a chair in the basement?
Yes.
Okay.
Are there any weapons?
Do you see anything, any weapons or anything?
Nancy, do you see any weapons?
She's hysterical, ma'am.
I can't really talk to her.
Okay.
Try to get that for us if you can, ma'am.
Can you tell how he might have been traumatized?
Nancy, can you tell...
Nancy, can you tell how he was traumatized?
asking me. She's been beheaded, she's saying, she's safe. Do you want to talk to her directly
because I could do that? I could give you her phone number. Oh, there's somebody there now,
she says. All right, she just hung up. Do you still want me to stay? Now, ma'am, what did you say? You said
he was beheaded? Yes, but there's a cop there now. I guess you might need to just talk to the cops
Okay, so the lady...
Hang on just a second, ma'am.
Okay, so she said he was beheaded and she said that...
Okay, ma'am, you said the subject was beheaded
and then she said an officer pulled up and disconnected, is that right?
Right.
Okay, what is the phone number you have for her?
Okay, what is her name?
Nancy Zimmerman.
Okay, we do have officers on scene right now, Terry.
I'm going to go ahead and let you go, okay?
Okay, that's fine.
Thanks, Terry.
Bye-bye.
