Please, Parvett.
Hello?
Yes.
We've just been robbed.
We're at?
220 South Sea Street.
220 South Sea.
Okay, we got officers out.
22ndi South Sea?
What's your night?
Are you hiding?
I'm in my bedroom.
You're in your bedroom, okay?
We have officers out there, okay?
What's up?
Hang on just a second.
This is a kid in the bedroom.
Is anybody else there with you?
Yes, my sister's.
And my mom and my stepdad went to the palm shop and stuff, and they stole the iPad in the PS3.
Are you all in there by yourself?
Yes.
Are you in a bedroom? Stay right there, okay?
Yes, sir.
I believe, hang on just a few that run out.
Did you see how many came in?
Like eight.
Huh?
Four or five.
Four or five?
Yes.
Can you hear anybody else in there?
No.
No.
I think they went in their bedroom.
I think they wanted my stepmoms and my step-dubs in my mom's bedlam.
Okay.
We're chasing some of them right now, okay?
So you stay right where you are, and we'll get some, just stay on the line with me, okay?
Yes, sir.
You're okay?
I think the officers are out chasing some of these guys, okay?
Do you want me to go in our closet?
Huh?
She wants to go in the closet.
If that'll make you feel safer, you go right ahead and do that, okay?
Yes, sir.
All right.
But you all are in there, okay?
Yes, sir.
I don't get your bedroom and there's a prison.
5.09.
Where are they going to take us?
Just hang on.
I have a 10-year-old, an 8-year-old that's in the bedroom, in the room with the crib.
They're hiding in the closet, so they'll be expecting you to come through.
Here's the door on the closet.
Okay, they're in the house now, so if you hear something, they'll probably be our officers, okay?
Just stay there and let them fight, okay?
They're going to be coming through the house, but they're coming in slow, okay?
So they're going to be looking to make sure anybody else is in there.
You may hear them say, you know, police or something like that.
I can hear them now.
You can hear, okay, just stay on the line with me.
I'm on the line.
It ain't anything or...
It just needs to be police out. I can't hear them now.
I can hear them.
Okay.
Whenever you might, whenever they come in, if you can, can you see out that ruined door at all or?
Do you want me to open anything?
No.
No, don't, don't open it.
That, let them, let them, if you hear them open the door, say, it's us.
Yes, sir.
Okay.
Yes, sir.
I'm impressed. You're doing real good, okay?
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
Okay
I said we got to, little girl
Okay
Don't open the door, don't open the door
Do they can you open the door?
Did he say you open the door?
No, they told us not to them.
Do what?
They told us that too.
Okay, it's us
I'm on the phone with them.
I'm on the farm with them.
The police.
Okay.
You with them?
I'm on the phone with the police.
I'm on the phone with the police.
I wanted the police told us we could hang up.
Okay.
Good job, okay.
Good job.
Bye-bye.
