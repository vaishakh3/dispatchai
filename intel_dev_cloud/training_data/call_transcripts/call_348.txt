Yes.
White Giazo is on the line. We're going as well.
Okay.
How old?
He's a 30-year-old male.
Shot to the left side in the chest.
It's got bubbles coming out of the nose.
It's definitely a sucking chest wound.
Was it on purpose?
I don't know. I think it was an accident.
We got help on the way, okay?

What is his name?
His name is Justin Thomas.
He rolls head to the side, see if you can get the blood out of his mouth.
Is he breathing?
Are you guys by yourself?
No, I got two people here.
We're trying to do first aid.
Was he there by himself when it happened?
No, um, what happened, dude?
He was all here, but what's this?
He was not there?
I think it was an accident involving his son.
I'm not sure.
He just came, he came over to get some stuff.
I was in bed, a buddy of mine was here with him.
Okay, how old is his son?
The child's about, three, four.
Okay. Is it a pistol?
Yeah, there was a 380 caliber pistol on a countertop.
Okay.
Where is the gun right now?
I moved it.
Here, put pressure on this so I can unload it, so they're not worried about it.
Okay, go ahead and secure the weapon, and then I'm going to help you with him with some first aid, okay?
Let me know when the weapon is secured.
The weapon's secure, and then it's definitely a round missing, I think.
Okay, and what's your name, sir?
Wait, hold on.
Hold on.
There's five, there's six rounds here, so I don't know what the fuck's happening.
Okay, just, just, what your name?
Okay, the weapon's secure.
My name is James.
James, okay. Are you in the room with him right now?
Yes.
Okay. Is he awake?
He's non-responsive. He's breathing. There's bubbles coming out of his mouth.
Okay. He looks pretty bad.
I mean, there's bubbles coming out of his mouth on occasion.
He's not breathing regularly.
I want you to lay him flat on his back, okay?
He's flat on his back right now.
Okay. Is there any pillows under his head?
No.
Okay.
Put his head down.

chin up. Let's head back, chin up. Okay. James? Yeah. Got him flat on his back, nothing under
his head? Flat on his back? Nothing under his head. Nothing under his head. Okay. We're going to start
CPR. Okay. Okay. Let me know when you're ready. Okay. Hold on out there. Speaker.
Are you ready, James?
Yep.
Okay, you can hear me good?
Okay, place the heel of your hand on his breastbone in the center of the chest right between his nipples.
Put your other hand on top of that hand.
Ready?
Okay.
Are you ready?
Yes.
Okay, I want you to pump the chest hard and fast 30 times twice per second.
Let the chest come all the way up between pumps and tell me when you're done.

Let me know if you find anything other than the blood.
That's like that.

blood?
I'm sorry?
It's thicker and darker than blood.
Okay.
With your hand under his neck, I want you to pinch his nose closed.
Tilt his head back, and I want you to give him two regular breaths.
You don't have to if you don't want to.
I know there's a lot of blood there.
It's fine.
Did you do that, James?
James?
James, can you hear me?
We're going to go back to compressions, okay?
We're going to be sure if that's it.
I'm sorry?
This guy?
This is by a three-year-home?
Yes, we think so.
We're not very sure what happened here.
Is someone there with you?
No, our firefighters are here, we're good.
Okay, I'll let them talk to you, okay.
