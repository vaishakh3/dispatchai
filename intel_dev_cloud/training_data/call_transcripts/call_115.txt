Stay right here.
Stand on one.
What is the one to get in here?
Hey, hey, I need a sheriff.
I don't have them to the corner of Reef and Weimus.
What's going on there?
I got three people attacking people.
They're attacking kids?
They're attacking kids?
Yes, sir.
Okay, is there any way you can get the animals away from them?
No, they have four guys here with bats.
They're trying to swim away.
I got this kid who was badly badly injured.
How old are the kids?
I had no idea.
Yeah, man.
Okay, are they like teenagers?
Are they little kids?
They're little kids.
They're little kids.
Do ten, twice.
Like toddlers?
Yes.
Hey, come back.
Hey, come back.
You got to stay here, bud.
You got to stay here.
I know, I know.
I know it hurts, my man.

Hey, I'm getting help over here, okay?
How many kids are injured, sir?
There's one kid.
It's one kid.
Do you have an ambulance coming?
Yes, we're getting ambulance on the way.
Okay, good deal.
I know, man.

I know, I know, man.
You got to stay here.
I know.
That's all right.
Where is the pit bull right now?
We're picking off.
Yeah, I got them.
They decided to take it off.
It's like there's a local sheriff's house right here.
So they're on the road somewhere, man.
Is that the child I'm hearing in the background?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It is, man.
Okay, all right, sir.
Let me get South West ambulance on the line with us, okay?
Stay on the line, don't hang up.
No, you're not, man, you're not, you're not, you're not.
You're not.

That's all right.
