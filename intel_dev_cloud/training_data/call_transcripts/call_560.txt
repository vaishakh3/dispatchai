Good morning.

Listen, have you heard anything going on the news?
We just saw a big airliner just being scored by two fire planes next to it.
Two what?
Five, five, two what?
We just saw a deadliner.
Uh-huh.
Fly low stealing above the Madica Center.
I think we were going to crash into us.
Hold on a second.
Two fighter planes next to it.
Hold on a second.
Start!
Guard?
Anybody know about anything about an air line and coming low on the metal?
Fetting?
Empty.
Nothing going on, they're just testing.

Okay.
No, no, what I'm 3 to 517, where's your emergency.
For whatever it's worth, I'm a motorist with a cell phone.
I was coming through Journal Square just now.
A four-engine passenger plane was making a sharp bank,
and there was a military fighter plane flying right alongside it.
For whatever it's worth, you know, I don't know what it means.
A passenger plane and a military plane were flying in general school.
Yeah, they flew over. They were high up. And the passenger plane was banking. It was making a sharp turn. And the military plane was flying right alongside it. Now, again, I don't know what that means. I just thought I'd better let somebody know. It just didn't look right. You know what I'm saying?
Okay, sir. That's all. We let the police know. Okay. All right.
