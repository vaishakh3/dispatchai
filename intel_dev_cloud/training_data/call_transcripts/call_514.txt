Hi, this is Donna Dashlet calling from Argan.
I'm up here in County N.
With all this commotion that's going on, should we evacuate our home?
No one has called us and told us anything about this until a little while ago.
We haven't got any information that we are to notify any residents.
or anything at this time.
So just stay put or...
If you feel concerned, I think I would possibly...
I mean, because we are right on top of the ridge up here on M.
I mean, right as you turn on M.
I mean, we're set way back in the woods,
and we're surrounded by woods around us.
Okay.
Is there a location that you can...
If you're...
Let me see if we can find here.
We are 9-067 County, and we're right on that big ridge, right where they redid the road this summer up here.

Pardon?
Your name is Linda?
No, Donna Dashlet.
My husband is Rick.
He works with the courthouse there.
Okay.
Like I said, Donna, we haven't heard anything as far as any kind of evacuation at this time.
Okay.
If you do not feel comfortable in your house, you can leave it.
Okay.
Which route would you take?
Well, it would be closest for us just to go to the right, right out here to Highway 3255,
right towards our ground lumber, because we're probably a mile from the highway.
Is the highway open?
I mean, are they letting anybody through?
door.
Donna, let me see if I can find something.
Yeah, I'm just going to tell them the same threat.
Donna, right now it would probably be best to just stay in forrest vents.
Okay.
Okay, don't go out, nobody outside at all.
No, I'm not sure if you can get through on the road right now.
Okay.
If you find out more to the point where we should evacuate, would you please call us?
