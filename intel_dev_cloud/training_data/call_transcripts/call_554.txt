I don't want to work, son.
What?
No.
There's no underneath the wheels of the car.
She ran over three people who is?
Where?
Where?
Where are he Alexander?
Godway Alexander?
Go on right, Alexander.
There's one chop on their wheels now.
Stop!
Okay, what's your name?
Mike Velt.
A fireboat out and they ran over people.
She almost ran me over to, can you hear the screen?
You still at her?
Yep, I'm still here.
What's your name?
Mike Bills.
I almost had to club the window with a baseball bat to keep her from running a knee over.
Good news, Carter, is Broadway and April, actually.
Sorry, Broadway, April.
All right, the person who did, they're still there?
Yes, a woman in a dark car.
Okay, is she still there?
Yes, last day I recall, I haven't seen anybody leave yet.
I stepped back for fear I'd get run over.
I had to, like I said, I almost had to smash her winter to get her to notice
so she wouldn't run my butt over.
All right, are you near that car now?
Yes, sir.
Can you tell us a person under the car breathing?
I can't see it.
Face down, feet out.
You want me to check for a pulse?
Yes.
I did that some EMT training.
I hope I'm not going for a break in a window, but I had to do it to keep her from moving forward and crushing the guy any further.
He's still under the car.
I got the NPR.
I got the end of the phone.
Is there a pulse?
I don't know.
All right.
Because I had training too.
Check for a peripheral pause.
Hold on, sir.
You still want to go to the answer?
Yep, yep.
Okay, we're checking for a pulse.
Disco pulse.
We're checking.
Disco pulse, we're checking.
I can't feel anything new.
Wait a minute.
No nerve.
No nerve, no nervous reaction.
No distal pulse.
I think he's dead.
I think he's dead.
I can't find any pulse, any movement.
No radio pulse, no distal pulse, no nerve reactions.
One hundred, one hundred and, one under, one hundred.
The lady was driving the car, do you know where she went?
Don't worry, he's sitting right in the car right now.
So she moves, no offense to her, her ass is mine.
Do you know where I'm coming from?
Do you know what I'm coming from?
Did somebody get a bikini out of her?
Your ass is mine.
You sit right in that car, woman.
I don't give it a damn.
You just ran over three people.
You move your ass is mine.
I got him on the floor right now, Dave.
I'm working.
The department's on the road.
Yes.
She's one dollar under the car and probably dead.
One,
awake and conscious and verbal.
Yes.
I want to foot move.
Can you move this one?
Okay, I said.
Which right can you move, sweetheart?
Don't move too much.
Are you still with me, officer?
Yep, yep.
I'm not going on any place.
Don't do you go on let me on with you please.
Do you give me that much?
Don't go on my shoe and let me all, all, all right?
One, I got two, I got three, and one under the car, presumed dead.
Okay.
So, I don't know what else I can tell you.
Okay.
Before the police are on the way.
Just one, two, three or four, two ambulances.
Okay.
Three patrols, two crash wagons, EMPs.
All right, they'll take care of you from here.
All right, I'm down and out.
Mike, can you do it?
Do you my favor? Tell me your name, your phone name and your phone number in case you need to get a hold of you?
Yes, because I was with, I was just ready to yell tonight. Let me cross the street and get out of them.
Yep.
Excuse me, all right.
Yep.
Stay with me, stay with me. Stay with me. I'm trying to get out of the street myself.
Not right now, please.
Not right now.
I'm talking to the neighbor who just jumped out of this house.
Michael.
There's some, Mike.
You got that?
Michael, Bill's like the football team.
Okay. What's your cell phone number, Michael?
Uh, oh, good. Get my shit together here.
It's really.
Two.
Okay. And what's your home number?
Uh, that's the only one I have to. I had, I had an accident.
And it's my life line. It never leaves my pocket.
No. That's right.
And I was just out. I was studying. I studied religion and philosophy, and I was up studying Greek and Hebrew.
and I heard people arguing, and I just at that point, went in the house, went to grab out of baseball bat, and said, you know, for my own protection, and I yell, hey, guys, come on, knock it off. It's 2 o'clock in the morning, right?
And all of a sudden the band of people got even louder and crazier, evidently the woman in the car, so somebody took a swing at me after the fact she said someone took a swing at me, right?
And what she did is she just threw the car in gear cranked, the wheels, and just land right through the proud of people.
And one of his is dead under the wheels.
I couldn't get a distant pulse.
I couldn't get an arterial pulse.
I couldn't get any nerve reactions.
Nothing.
There was one way underneath the passenger side
just behind the front wheel well, and he's dead.
I can't imagine he'll live.
And she was trying to move the car and spinning the wheels
as I'm yelling at her to stop.
I'm standing right in front of her
where the inspection sticker is on the windshield.
And the gentleman's trapped under the wheels
and she's spinning her tires
than rolling his body even more.
Finally, I just took and shoved it right through the glass in the windshield at her.
I don't know if I'm going to be legally.
Do you know what I'm saying?
Yep, yep, I'm certain.
I don't want to be in trouble for breaking a windshield,
but I have not to let somebody.
No, nobody's going to care about her windshield.
I had to do something to get her attention.
No, that's right.
She was going to drag this body in me even further than the force you hit.
Okay.
So I just stuck the axel right through the window,
and I looked at her.
I said, you move out.
You move your line.
And you move your mind.
That's okay.
And some other people came and were going to.
And there was another guy that has EMP training and he was checking for a driftful pulse.
What I want you to do, Mike, is can kind of be patient there?
Yes, I will.
I want you to make you way over to one of the police officers and let them know that you were sitting on your porch and you saw the whole thing.
I just...
All right.
I usually know some of the boys on the beat here.
I have what they say boys in the bag.
kind of mentality.
Would you like me to find the friendly face and let them know.
Yeah.
Because, you know, you've got more information than just, you know, coming up on the
excuse me, sir, sir, sir.
Boy, you're an ignorant.
Excuse me.
I'm at the tape.
Just a minute.
Listen to me.
I got them on the phone.
I don't know who you are on the phone.
All this side of the tape right now.
Right.
Would you like?
Would you like?
No, I want to operate it.
No, I want to go.
Well, who's good?
No, what happened to that I'm going?
Then I'm here, ma'am.
You're right, thank you.
Okay.
