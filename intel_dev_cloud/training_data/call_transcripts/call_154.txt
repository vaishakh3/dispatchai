Now I'manda's Michelle. How can I help you?
Hi, this is Letitia from the store Big Five on Green Valley.
I have a person that is robbing me right now of my firearms.
I need police to the store immediately.
Okay. Is he still in the store?
He is still in the store and he is getting my gun and he is breaking the lock with tools.
Okay.
Is he white, black or Hispanic?
He is Hispanic.
About how old?
He is born.
He gave me his ID. He actually came to purchase again. And he is 1989. So, I'm 22.
We'll call her shirt or jacket. Huh?
What color shirt or jacket?
He's wearing a black shirt, black jeans. It has writing on his shirt. He's five foot seven, 150 pounds.
Where is he now? He's in the firearms counter and he is thawing away at my firearms.
He's sawing off the gun. He's sawing off the gun in his hand and he's sawing it off.
And he's the back of my firearms counter. I have ammunition. I have everything back there.
What do you mean by sawing off the gun?
He's got a boot, like an electric blade, like a saw blade.
He is sawing my gun in half. He just grabbed the ammunition.
He's actually loading the gun. Please send someone.
Okay. We've been on the way since we started talking.
Okay.
Yeah, he's loading the firearm.

It's like a rasta kind of looking shirt.
Are you open for business?

He is walking.
towards the front of the store.
He is not leaving the store.
He is right at my doors.

making the transaction and usually when i make the transaction when i'm looking around it's just kind of
We're trained to do that to make sure that something like this doesn't go on.
And there was nobody else that came in that looked like it was any connection.
