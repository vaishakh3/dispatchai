Hi, I have a suicidal teenager at House 503 Nighthawk Drive. I need an ambulance immediately.
What's your name?
Calm down and tell me your address again.
Excuse me?
Tell me your address, ma'am.
503, Nighthawk Drive.
And your phone number there.
Tell me exactly what happened.
It's still happening. He is trying to kill himself. I need an ambulance now.
Ms. Roberts, yelling at me is not helping. I'm asking someone else is sending the unit.
Answer my questions. How is he trying to harm himself?
He is trying to stab himself.
Does he have a knife?
Yes.
How old is he?
He's 20.
Who is he?
What happens?
Where is he at right now?
I'm getting help. Ma'am, listen. Miss Roberts, stop.
Somebody else is already dispatching help to you.
My asking questions is not delaying that. It's helping them.
I don't know what I'm going to be. I understand that. Okay. I understand that. Where is he at with the knife?
I don't know. Okay. He left the house. Okay. You do know. He left the house. Did he leave on foot or did he leave in a car?
He left on foot, but I don't know where he's saying. Okay. What's he looked like?
He's African American. He's not very tall. About 5'7, he has kind of, like, it's not an afro, but it's short. I think he's not like that's like that.
Okay, you're, ma'am, ma'am, calm down for me.
You're not helping anybody by being out of control.
