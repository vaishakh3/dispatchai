911.
What is the address of your?
Hi, you need to get the police.
Honey, you need the street.
Just ran over and they said that the young boy just shot his mom.
We've had the police here before.
Gunshot.
I don't even know what their last name is.
It's African Americans.
We've had the police out here before, and the mom had the cops out of Easter.
So it's across the time for you?
Yes.
Yes.
I'm going to get my cordless phone.
All right.
Okay.
All right.
Hold on.
All right there, 314, 313, 6, and signal 45.
48?
We knew this was going to happen, you guys.
Okay.
Ten four.
Cheryl, tell four and five.
We got a 45 on Bright.
Okay, ma'am?
Yes, ma'am.
Okay.
He said that he shot his mother?
It don't matter, Tim, just go take it out of her.
The kid said that the youngest kid shot his mom.
Is he still there?
Get out and get back.
You're not coming in our house.
The boys in my front yard used to get in the town.
He's got blood on his right side.
How old is he?
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
She advised that the son is outside.
her resident. He has blood on his right side.
The guy's that the youngest son, Signal 45, the mother.
Okay, is the guy who shot him there?
He's going back to his house now.
Is he the one that shot the mother?
I don't know. I don't know.
You don't know a lot?
I don't know.
I just heard the kids say he just shot our mom.
I have no idea where his mom is.
You know is responding.
I'm talking to the neighbor.
and she advised at the time, went back over to the residence.
He just said that his brother shot his mother and he went back to the
mom.
Hold on now.
My husband's getting a different story now.
The mom shot the kids is now what they're telling.
Now they're saying the mother shot the kids.
Yeah, this is confusing because we.
Provided it all you know.
Now they're saying that the mother shot the son.
Saying that the mother shot the son complained that doesn't know what's going on.
Are you outside of your house?
No, we're staying in the house.
I'm not going out there.
Okay, who's...
I don't know who has the gun.
Here, hold on.
Talk to the dispatcher.
Hello?
They just...
They tried to break in our front door to get in, I guess, to get away from her,
whoever's got the gun.
So I grabbed my gun and ran outside,
and one's laying there bleeding right at our front door.
He's bleeding at the front door?
Is he still there?
No, he went back home.
And he went back inside the residence?
I guess.
I don't know who has the gun, so I'm not walking out there.
I'm armed, but I'm not going out there and put myself in danger.
You know their address?
10-4.
The Votile units, 1033.
Now there's more gunshots.
Votile units, call his advice.
He's here more gunshots.
He's here more gunshots.
Ellen, get over here away from the door.
I don't care.
Get away from the door.
Ten four, they have five units, 51, two years.
I cannot believe somebody's not here by now.
I mean...
Sir, I have two deputies out there already.
They've been there for a minute.
All right.
All right, see you.
You done with me?
No, sir.
I want you to...
You want me to what?
I want you to stay on the phone with me.
Here, the wife's on the phone.
Oh, my God, she's still over there shooting, whoever's shooting.
You still have another shot?
Yes.
There's like six.
Okay, I have units out there.
We can go ahead and disconnect.
Just stay in the house, okay?
I am.
All right, thank you.
All right, bye.
It might be going through now.
Hi, can you advise how many people
live in that house, do you know?
There's four children, four children
and a mom. Four children and a
mother live in the house. Do you know how old the kids are?
Oh, God.
One, 17, 15,
probably
14 and 11.
Okay, ranging in age from 11 to 17.
Yeah. Sheriff's
office was out there Easter Day because
the one boy kicked the windows out. You might have a record
of who the mom is then.
Yeah.
Okay, I'm going to keep you on the line with me for a couple minutes.
Okay, I've got units 11 to 17.
She's outside now.
Mom's outside.
Are they all boys, do you know?
No, there's two girls and two boys.
Two girls and two boys.

Are the cops coming yet?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, we've got a couple, we've got a helicopter coming, we've got all kinds of stuff.
Helicopters coming?
Yeah, and several units.
Oh, my God, me.

You said the police were out there on Easter?
No, I don't.
I just seen the spotlight, but the mom's out.
She's the one with a gun.
You said the mother is outside now and she's the one with a gun?
That's what, yeah.

Okay.
We're in the area.
I can assure you they're setting up a good parameter.
Just stay inside.
Yes.
I have problems with these guys ever since.
They moved in.
But there's been problems over there.
Do you actually see a female right now with a gun?
Is it a handgun or a rifle?
I don't know what it is.
Okay.
Complaintiff does not know what type of gun.
You know what kind of gun has been?
It's dark out there and she was in that house when we first called.
The two kids were in our front yard.
One banging on the door.
Help us help us.
And like I said, there was so much confusion going on the street.

I'm calling back, I don't know what to ask you know
I'm sorry
Hello?
Man, this is the sheriff's office scan
I'm sorry
They're requesting that I keep you landline, okay?
Okay.
Have you heard or seen anything additional?
You were in your husband?
No.
I can hear them out there hollering from somebody to their hands up, but I don't see anything.
Okay.
I'm landline with her.
He said that my husband said they were all in the house.
Shelly, I'm going to turn you up a little bit if this gets annoying.
Just tell me.
Are the occupants at the house, are they white or black?
They're black.
Okay.
She said the residence are black.
One's name is Joel.
One's name is Pebbles.
It's a girl.
One, they call Jacks or Romeo.
The mom's name is Tanya.
And I don't know what the other girl's name is.
Peanuts is the oldest daughter.
Then it's Jack.
And I believe the girl.
And then Joel.
So the mother is Tanya.
Okay.
You said my
saving.
I don't know.
We said the mom's name is Tanya.
Okay.
And then it's Joel, Pebbles, and Jacks, or Romeo?
Yeah.
And then I'm not sure what other girl's name is.
Okay.
Have you seen them go in my house, can?
My husband.
said he's seen them all the kids run back in the house.
Adrian Moss is close friends with Tanya.
No, they cannot. No.
I'm sorry, ma'am.
They're asking us questions in here.
I'm still in the driveway.
I'm still with you, ma'am.
I'm just waiting to see if they have any other questions, okay?
I'm standing back looking to these skills in our house.
All the lights are told we all.
The lights are all up in the house, okay.
Do you hear that's the way they're at Curtis in Delphast?
Yeah.
Okay, we've got an ambulance on the scene.
That's what they're saying.
Oh.
And they have a female.
And they're just requesting that Keith going on the line, okay?
Yeah.
The line is just a great thing you think.
I was just thinking, I heard two shots.
When we were sleeping, I thought I was dreaming, and I heard two shots,
and then you could hear pounding, and then two more shots,
and then it dawned on us.
You know, somebody's going on.
Right.
I got you.
So it was going a little bit earlier than when you called?
Probably 30 seconds or so, but...
Okay.
And then they started pounding on the door.
You know, we didn't dare open the door.
Come in, what the heck?
Right.
I understand.
Do you know who was, which one of them was knocking on your door?
No, he didn't answer the door.
I ran over by the phone.
No problem.
And did you say that the deputies were out there again?
Was that on Easter, you said?
On Easter Sunday, Jack, or Romeo?
He said he kicked out three windows.
We're just confirming your address, ma'am.
If you do hear any knock on your door, that's going to be my deputies.
but they haven't advised me anything yet, okay.
Ma'am, you still with me?
Uh, yeah.
What kind of vehicles are out front of your house?
Out in the corner of mine?
Yeah.
He sounds like he's got to be behind the trailway.
Do you want us to shut our porch lights off?
I don't want to know if she should try a force flight off.
Sure.
The lights are right above their head if they're behind.
Oh, she has one too?
She's got a black one that's in her driving and a maroon.
I need to call my job, my work, and tell them I'm not going to be...
Okay, ma'am.
Okay, ma'am. They haven't asked me for anything.
additional. I'm going to assume it's okay to disconnect. Do you have call waiting in case I do
try to call it? Yeah. Okay, I appreciate that. Thank you very much. All right, bye-bye.
