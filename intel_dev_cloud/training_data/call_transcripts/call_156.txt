911?
My dad has been physically and emotionally abusing me.
What your address?
He said I was acting perfect to my psychiatrist.
What address are you at?
Well, listen, at my psychiatrist, he, last month gave me a fever of 104 from stress,
throwing up in a fever, and the psychiatrist,
that I could have died, and he laughed, and I just killed him.
And he's dead right now, because I can't take the physical abuse.

Yeah.
My dad has been mentally abusive.
He could have killed me with 105 fever from stress.
All right, sir.
And he knows he's in the abuse every day, and I can't take it anymore,
and I fucking took a knife to him, and I killed him.
Sir?
Where are you?
I'm in my house.
I killed him because he is abusing me,
and my psychiatrist said he could have killed me.
My mom told my dad that the psychiatrist said he could have killed him,
and he said he didn't care if I died or not.
He complained we're starting to trace now, too.
Yes, yes.
