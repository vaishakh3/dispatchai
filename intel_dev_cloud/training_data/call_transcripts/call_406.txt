Do you, are you taking something right now?

Do you, by any chance, have any aspirin with you?
No, I don't think so.
Do you don't have any aspirin with you?
Okay, all right.
Well, my partner does have the ambulance on the way, okay?
You don't have to talk to me, but I'm just going to stay on here with you.
You okay?
Okay.
All right, Larry.
Did you just start feeling this way, or were you?
I've been fighting it for about 30 minutes.
I just left a scrap yard in Franklin County there, and I was trying to untie my trailer.
I started feeling real tightness in the chest, and I thought, okay, I better stop.
So I got in my truck and turned an air conditioner on it, it's not getting better.
It's not getting any better.
Okay, and you don't have any nitroglycerins or anything, and you don't think you have any aspirins?
No, I don't think so.
Okay.
Okay. Are you in your vehicle?
Oh, I'm sitting on the ground in front. I was going to try to lay down.
Okay. Yet you're more comfortable laying down.
Oh, man.
I feel like somebody's getting on my chest.
All right, Larry. Try to take some deep breaths. See if that helps you at all.
I'm trying to do that.
Yeah, I know it hurts. I know it hurts. It's all right, Larry. They're on the way.
There's nobody, you don't see anybody around or anything, do you? Nobody's stopping?
No, my wife's going to kill me.
No, she won't.
I don't die for her.
No, she'll just be glad you're okay.
We're getting help and she'll just be thankful that you're okay.
She won't be mad at you.
It's all right, Larry.
Is your wife at home?
Yeah, but I don't know if I want to call her.
No, no, no, we won't.
Yeah, no, I don't want to scare her, okay.
I'm not ready to go.
You're not got young grandkids.
You're tired, Larry.
It's okay.
It's all right.
You're going to be all right.
They're going to take care of you.
What are your grandkids' name?
Ryan and one kid.
and Lindsay, yeah. Ryan and Lindsay are going to see Grandpa pretty soon.
I don't see anybody coming. It's all right. Come on, stay with me, Larry, okay? Keep talking to me.
Try it. If you can.
What's your wife's name?
Kathy. Kathy? All right.
A short of breath. That's why I think that's what this is.
Okay. All right. Try and take some slow, deep breath for me, Larry. If you can, I know.
I'm going to make it.
Yes, you are. Yes, you are. Yes, you are.
are, Larry. Yes, you are. You're going to make it. They're on the way. How far away are they?
I'm not exactly sure how far they are from you, Larry, but you're going to make it.
I don't think so. I don't think so. Larry?
I'm not going to make it. Yes, you are. I'm not going to make it. I need to get in one.
Larry, you're going to be, the good Lord's going to take care of you, all right?
They're not going to get here and tell you. Yes, they are. They're going to be there. Is anybody stopping
No.
All right, Larry.
Can you stand up and see if you can get anybody to pull over?
What good are they going to do?
I'm just seeing if somebody's got to, you don't have any aspirin in your truck.
No.
No.
Oh, it's the aimless.
I'm not going to make it.
Yes, you are.
Wait, man, I see them.
You see them?
Yeah.
Okay.
Stay with me, okay?
I'm going to tell my partner something.
I'm seeing it.
Larry, do you see him?
I see them, but you're too far away.
Okay, all right, they're coming.
I can hear them.
They're coming.
All right, come on, Larry.
Stay with me, okay?
You got Ryan and Lindsay there waiting to see Grandpa.
I'm trying.
And we don't want to make Kathy mad, do we?
We'll try.
Yeah, you try.
You stay with me, okay?
Here is.
All right, are you laying down?
Yeah, we got them.
You got them?
All right.
Bye.
