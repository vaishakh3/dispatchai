Okay, what's the address, do you know?
What's the address?

Okay, sir?
Sir, calm down a little bit, okay?
I'm sorry, it's my brother.
Please come here.
Paul is he?
He's 23.
Calm down, okay?
If you can't calm down, get the phone to somebody else.
No, there's no one else around.
Okay.
I'm fine.
I think he's a red volume or something.
I don't know.
Who's with him right now?
Um, my sister, the people.
Okay, can you talk to her from where you are?
I'm trying to give him out to mouth to mouth.
Sir, calm down. Tell her not to give him out to mouth.
Don't give him mouth to mouth.
You only give him out to mouth that he's not breathing.
What's he doing? It just seems like he's sleeping right now?
Yeah, it just looks like you sleep, okay?
That's very normal, okay?
That's very normal. Sometimes it's been in fact, sometimes they do actually go to sleep.
If he goes into another seizure,
okay and sometimes they do that
just let him have a seizure
don't try and restrain them all right
what about putting my tip the hand in his mouth
do not put nothing in his mouth
okay he will not swallow his tongue
believe me
just let him go ahead and have a seizure
paramedics are in the way they should be there
sure
