Greenwood 911 may help you.
Oh, yes.
I need an officer of a 2007 Callison Highway.
What's wrong?
Oh, I'm just stressed out, and I'm about to take my life.
I mean, what's your name?
It's unknown.
Okay, do you have a weapon with you?
Huh?
Do you have a weapon with you?
Yes.
What do you have, sir?
I'm 44.
Get in there.
Don't bleed at me.
What's going on?
