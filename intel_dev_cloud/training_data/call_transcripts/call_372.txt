I'm sending the paramedics to help you now.
Stay in the line.
I'll tell you exactly what to do next.
Do not try to prevent the birth.
Do not sit on the toilet.
Allow her to assume the most comfortable position
and have her take deep breaths between the contractions.
Okay.
Have you called the health care provider?
No, not yet.
Okay.
We're just going to go out of hospital.
Okay.
Hold on for just a minute.
Yeah, I see that.
More water is coming out right now.

Okay.
Lay her on her back in the center of the bed or on the floor.
Okay.
I'm going to help tell you how to help deliver the baby.
Okay.
Okay.
Make sure all the clothing below her waist is removed.
Okay?
Raise her head with pillows, but do not let her sit up or go to the bathroom.
Okay.
Get towels and check pushing.
Check towel, okay.
Okay.
Get some dry towels and a blanket to wrap the baby in.
Okay.
Okay.
You're going to need to get a string or a shoelace to tie around the little.
umbilical cord after the delivery.
A shoe or two?
All right.
Anything.
I'm getting my shoe lake off right now.
Okay.
Okay.
All right.
Shur lace.
Okay.
Sorry, off the electrical cord?
Okay.
When the baby's born, just have it available.
Okay.
If you can get a safety pin also, that will help possibly too.
She's trying not to push.
Don't try and prevent. Just breathe. Just breathe. Breathe.
Is she pushing or straining yet?
Are you pushing or straining? No.
Okay, just keep breathing?
She has contractions.
Okay.
I want you to look at her regina very carefully to see how close the baby is to being born.
I can see the baby's head.
You can see the baby's head, okay.
With each contraction...
The baby's head, baby's heads, all the way out.
The baby's head.
Okay, place your palm against the baby's head.
hand of her vagina and apply firm but gentle pressure to keep the baby's head from delivering too fast.
Okay.
And it'll keep her from tearing.
Okay.
As the baby delivers, support the baby's head and shoulders and hold the hips and legs firmly.
Okay.
Remember the baby will be slippery, don't drop it.
Okay, got the baby.
Is the baby out?
Not yet.
Okay.
Okay, baby's out.
Baby's out.
Okay, is the baby crying?
Yes, yes.
All right.
Okay, gently wipe off the baby out.
baby's mouth and nose, dry the baby off with a clean towel.
Okay.
Wrap the baby in the clean, dry towel.
Okay.
Cover the baby's head, but not its face.
Without pulling the cord tight, put the baby in the mother's arm or on her belly.
Be sure to keep the baby and the mom warm.
Okay.
Okay.
We're going to tie the cord.
You know that shoelace?
Yes.
Okay, listen carefully, and I'm going to tell you what to do next.
Without pulling on the cord, tie the shoe lace tightly around the umbilical cord about six inches from the baby.
Do not cut it.
Okay.
Let me know when it's done.
Okay.
I'm tying every now.
Okay.
You're doing great, Dad.

Okay.
And she'll go to court side.

Okay.
I don't see any additional blood.

You've done a great job, Dina.
No, you're not supposed to cut it yet.
I mean, I wasn't going to make it to the hospital.
This was your third baby?
Yeah.
