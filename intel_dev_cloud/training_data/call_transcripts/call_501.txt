Fire emergency.
My mom is in the bathroom and she can't get up.
And I have a little sister and a big sister and two big brothers and the dad.
And so can he tell my dad and my brothers.
Okay.
Are they at home with you?
Uh, yeah, but, but not my big brothers.
Okay, well, can I, can I, are your dad's with you?
Yeah.
And can I talk to him?
Yes.
Okay, can you give the phone to him?
Uh, no, he's at his work.
Okay, so he's not home with you.
You're home alone with your mom?
Yeah.
No one else there.
Is your mom awake?
Uh, yeah.
And what happened?
Um, she, she grew up and then she fell.
And then she can't bear up.
Okay, is she still awake and talking to you, though?
Oh, yeah.
Can you take the phone to her?
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
Mom, he said, can I keep the phone to you?
No, he goes.
Okay, you're sick, or what happened?
I don't know.
Did you pass out or?
Yeah.
Okay.
How old are you?
I'm 30.
Okay.
All right.
Well, we're on the way.
We're the babies.
Okay.
We'll have someone there to take care of it.
We're on the way.
My babies are not there.
Okay.
We're on the way.
Okay, we're on the way.
We'll be right there.
Okay.
We're on the way.
We're right there.
Hey, can you tell me. Are you there?
Hello.
We lived in the same score three.
You what?
We lived in the same score free.
free.
Okay.
Well, the firemen are on the way to help your mom.
They'll be there in a minute, okay.
We're in the street for free.
Oh, bounty drive?
Yeah.
Thank you.
I have that.
And the firemen are on the way.
They'll be there pretty quick.
Thanks.
Okay.
Why don't you just stay on the phone with me?
I'll tell you when you need to go open the door for them, okay?
Okay.
How old are you?
Um, four.
Okay.
Has your mom been sick the last couple days or what?
Um.
Um, yeah, she, she didn't think a lot of times, and she's been better a lot of times.
Okay.
And now she tends to up.
All right.
So do you have a little sister or brother there in the high chair?
Um, I have a little sister here, but no big brother or big sister.
Okay, and your little sister's in the high chair?
They're at their dad.
I don't know when they would get back.
Okay.
Is your little sister in the high chair?
Yeah.
And she's raining dinner.
Okay.
How old is she?
I don't know.
Okay.
Well, is she really little, or does she talk yet, or does she crawl?
She doesn't crawl.
She only walks, and she can talk.
All right.
And she can say animals and person.
So she's probably like two years old?
Um, yeah.
Okay.
She called and then she walks.
Right.
Well, we all have to do that.
What's she having for dinner?
Um, she's having noodles.
Noodles, okay.
Yeah, and my mom did.
But I'm not having noodles because I just, because I just,
I'm waiting for my toy house.
Okay.
So can you tell my dad and my mom is at the hospital?
They're going to be lots of people there to help you
and they'll figure out how to get a hold of your dad when they're there, okay?
Okay.
And they'll get in touch with him.
Where does he work?
Um, when we ask my mom where he works.
Well, that's okay.
They can ask her when they get there.
Oh, well, wait, I know where he works.
He works by the jelly bean factory.
Oh, the jelly bean factory?
Yeah.
He works at it or he works by it?
Um, he, he doesn't work fire if it's just by some houses and his work, it is by it.
Okay.
And when every time we go to the jury, then we see that first,
and then we go back home, and then we go back home.
And then right now, mom fell, and she tent her up, and now she's sick.
And my little sister is in the high chair.
and my little sister is trying to get out of the high there, but she's buckled up.
Okay, well, that's good.
She's buckled up because she has a toy or something you can give her, maybe to play with?
Yeah, I have some of my toys and I could give her.
Probably should only be one of the toys that's for her.
Like, did she have a stuffed animal or something like?
Okay, I will.
Well, okay, you stay on the phone with me.
Can you walk around with the phone?
Yeah.
And is your mom still awake?
Yeah.
Oh, Hunt, do you have a dog?
Yeah, we have two dogs.
Are they inside the house?
One name Harko is and one name Shago.
That's my dog.
Are they both inside the house?
Yeah.
Are you able to, like, maybe put them in a bedroom and close the door so the firemen don't
scare the dogs when they get there?
Um, I'm sure, but I got a window at the phone.
But her coat is in my brother's room.
Okay, the door closed?
Yeah, and but Chico isn't in my room.
Okay.
How long is the 5'5?
Oh, they're just around the corner.
They should be there in just a couple minutes.
Okay, but I'll try.
to get my dog.
Well, that's okay.
That's okay.
They'll take care of it when they get there.
Okay.
How's your little sister doing?
I gave her a flag, and now she dropped it, and now I'm giving it back to her.
But where do you guys promised to not get my mom a flu check?
Are you guys?
Are we what?
Are you guys going to give her a flu?
Oh, I don't, I don't think they would give her a flu shot.
Oh, but...
Is your mom still awake?
Yeah, let me check.
Mom, will you promise to still be awake?
All right, she's talking to you. That's fine. I can hear her.
That's okay.
Okay.
But will you ask the firefighters, um,
to hurry here because my mom is going to sleep.
She's what?
She's starting to dozy.
All right, yeah, they're right around the corner.
They should be there any minute.
Do you know, has you ever heard anyone say your mom has diabetes?
No.
Okay.
But can you promise her to tell the firefighters to take on after 101?
that stuff.
Take off their what?
Oh, they don't wear helmets when it's a medical call, hun.
Oh.
They won't wear their helmets in.
Do they wear their garments still?
Wear the what?
Well, they just wear regular uniforms when they go on a medical call.
Oh, well, when you promise to tell them to not.
scare us?
Oh, they are going to scare you, hon.
I'm going to tell you, they're almost there.
I'm going to have you go open the door for them when they pull up out front.
Okay.
Comey.
Uh, no, I can't.
Okay.
Okay.
At the other door, I...
Okay.
Okay.
What did you come out, honey?
Um, my mom is from the boy's bathroom.
My mom is going to have a boy back zone.
The boy back to do.
Do you hear?
Here.
