Here for mention 9-1-1, what's the address of the emergency?
I'm at one-word place.
Can I repeat that address?
W-E-T-D-A-L-E place.
This is a house on the apartment.
House.
What's your name?
What's the phone number you're calling me from?
I'm calling you from my cell, which is...
Tell me exactly what happened.
something is going on
do you know the house number
no
he has been screaming
for about 30 minutes
on the front porch
and then he goes in
and he scream
that he's God
I mean
I mean like delusional kind of stuff
I mean
he stood like into this
monologue on his
This is not typical at all.
I mean, this isn't, you know, some fat boy.
This is like a grown man.
Do you think he does alcohol, iron bars off?
I don't think so.
I would not think so.
I mean, I should be wrong.
I don't know.
I just know it's gotten scary because he comes out and he screams.
And at one point, I was kind of looking for my window.
I thought he was talking to someone.
He dropped his pants out there.
and he was screaming that he's God
and then he slams the door
and then he goes in and he
starts ranting
and this has been going on for
a half an hour a son
and he goes back out on the porch
and I mean it's
it's a little scary
okay you don't know if he drugs
for alcohol
I have no idea
how old is he
I don't know
late 30s, 3040s, something like that.
Okay.
I can't even tell you.
White, black, it's been in it?
No, no.
Well, is he white or is finix?
He's white.
What's he wearing?
Last time I saw him he was in a t-shirt and nothing else.
Okay, so he was only wearing a t-shirt?
Well, he had something.
I haven't actually walked out there.
I'm afraid to walk out there.
He was in something in a T-shirt, and then he pulled down his pants when he was screaming,
I am God, or I don't know, I think God has, like, flipped out over there.
Okay.
No, no problem.
Do you want the police to come by and speak with you after they investigate?
I see no reason.
Okay, that's completely okay. The police would be out there as physically as possible.
And I have heard this guy say in the past, I mean, I don't want to be in a law on this, but I have heard him say he has a gun.
Now, I mean, not in a threatening way, but I've heard him say that.
Okay.
We had a neighborhood disturbance one time and he made some all-hand comment about having a gun.
So, and I'm a good crazy cat, so.
Okay.
I just don't know what's going on.
How long did he scream this?
I'm sorry?
About how long did he scream this?
How long has he been screaming out here?
How long, when did he scream he at a gun?
Oh, this was like, I don't know.
A few months ago.
I was just making that offhand comment.
No, no, no.
Hey, you're being.
Well, I'm concerned that there seems to be a deranged man screaming next door, and I'm just...
I completely understand.
I mean, the things outside naked and screaming.
I mean, you did the right thing by calling, okay?
Okay.
Okay, the police will be out there as quickly as possible.
You do stay safe inside your home, okay?
All right, I will.
Thank you.
Have good night.
You too.
