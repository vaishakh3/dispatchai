Community County 911, what's the address to the emergency?
We're on the boat right now.
Our friend just got it by a shark.
We have them in.
All right.
I need to know where are you bringing them in.
Are you bringing them in to Anna Maria, a broad and real pier.
A broad and real pier, okay.
What's your phone number in case to get disconnected?
We'll be there in about five minutes.
Okay.
What's your phone number in case to get disconnected?
It's 941.
Okay, and you'd be there in about how many minutes?
About five minutes.
We're all in there right now.
How about the vote are you in?
We're in a 26-foot Pan Verado.
Pan Marada?
Dorado with a D-O-R-A-D-O.
Okay.
All right, and your friend was bitten by a shark?
A shark, yes.
In his upper, I believe his upper left side.
Okay.
Are you with him now?
We are with him now.
How old is he?
How old is he?
How old is he?
He's 22.
Okay, is he awake.
I'm going back off there.
He is awake.
He is awake.
He is crazy.
He's awake and crazy.
He's awake and raised him.
He's awake up and trapped the rope around on the top of his side.
Okay.
I'm here.
I'm here.
Okay.
Is there any serious?
Okay.
Yes, but he is a subduly police.
Okay, if he completely alert.
They're going to meet you there.
He's completely alert.
He is alert.
Okay.
They're giving him some water.
He wants to water.
Okay.
Okay.
And what part of his body was injured?
You said his left side.
It's going to be his upper left side.
His what?
Upper left side.
His leg.
A third of his leg?
Yes, it was his leg.
Okay.
Yeah, I told him not in real.
Do you hear me okay?
I can hear you, okay?
The paramedics are on their way.
Okay.
Okay.
A dry cloth or towel?
Yes, we do have a dry cloth.
You have a dry cloth or towel.
Okay.
Dry cloth or towel.
Place it directly on the womb, press down firmly and do not lift it up to look.
Put this on it to dry.
Get his wet off there and put the dry.
Okay.
They're putting it around right now.
Okay.
And do they have the bleeding under control?
No, I do not want them to press down firmly.
Do not lift up the look.
If it bleeds through that, put another towel on top of it without lifting the initial one up, okay?
That's right.
He's wrapping that one around now and then he's going to hold it.
Okay, is it his lower lake or upper lake that has been bitten?
His upper thigh.
Upper thigh?
Upper thigh?
Yes, ma'am.
Okay.
And was it complete, is there a complete tear-through or is it a clean bike?
It's a complete block, it looks like it's about, so jog or about a foot.
About one foot?
About one foot.
Nine and six to one foot.
It's a pretty, uh, it was a pretty large charge.
We are old in the 30 feet.
Um, we're almost to the pass now.
Okay.
I'm going to stay in the line with you until I guess everybody's meeting you at this.
Broad and real fear.
Okay?
Yes, ma'am.
He's still a conscience.
Okay.
Again, are you having that pleading under control?
I want you keep putting that firm pressure on him.
He has, basically, he's very firm around that.
You told him shut.
Okay, good.
And you know for a fact it was a shark?
Yes, yes.
Okay.
For a fact.
You can see, with the top part of the bite, that's not ripped off.
You can see the incision.
Okay.
They're probably going to need a hell off the posture.
I know that, ma'am.
We have everything under your side.
Sorry, they're in there.
They're making sure I tell you that.
I understand.
Is he still awake?
His eyes are close, but he is moving.
Okay.
I just look at me.
I try to keep him awake, okay?
Okay.
He's awake.
He just looked at me.
We have our one friend that's just holding it in trying to get him, you know, the base of just on himself.
He tried to what?
We have, he's, we have one guy that's ready.
Okay, now I'm funny.
How far out are you now?
We're almost in the past, probably about a mile, a mile and a half.
Okay.
Okay.
How are you doing now?
How is it doing now?
Wait.
She's awake.
Is they still awake?
He is still awake, makes sense.
Good.
Good.
He is Lucy a lot of blood, though.
He's black.
Give us another cow, please.
We're going to put another.
Connor, leave that call where it is, but I'm going to get another one and wrap this one around and two.
Right.
You're not with any of them on, just keep putting them on top of each other.
Yep.
Got it.
Got it?
Okay.
Okay.
Got the second one on there?
Okay, good.
Okay, how far is the lookout now?
About how far out now?
About how far out?
Okay, how far?
Okay, a half mile from the point.
Okay, half a mile out from point?
Yeah, from the point here.
I'm just getting them updates as you tell me, okay?
Okay, that's fine.
How's you doing now?
He's still conscious.
Okay.
His hands are singly.
Okay.
How is that bleeding?
Okay.
How is that bleeding?
We have two towels on it.
It looks like the second towel.
Our first one left so much so has been released pressure from it yet.
Okay.
Is it bleeding through the second towel?
Is it bleeding through the second towel?
No, not yet.
Okay, good.
Tell me doing a great job.
Tell me keep pressing down firmly, okay?
Okay.
Thanks you're doing anything to have.
Connor, don't press your ass.
Okay.
We're about to go through the past right now.
Do you want to do the pass right now?
Yes, ma'am.
Open your eyes.
See your chance.
Okay.
Keep him awake.
Try to see your best you can.
Keep him away.
Okay.
His name, see if you want to his last name or anything?
No, that's okay.
Okay.
One.
His answer really tingling.
Okay. Is he still responding to you?
Yes, he is still responding.
Just let me know if his condition changes at all, okay?
Okay, I will.
We're about to turn around into the base side. We should have gotten real here in our vision.
You're turning into the base side now?
Yep. It should be in our vision within the next couple of seconds.
Okay. You'll probably see the fire truck.
Okay.
We have a black seat top too.
A what?
A black seat top, the boat?
A black top?
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay, we see rather real pierce.
Okay.
Okay, we're coming up to it now.
I see the fire test.
Okay, just let me know when they're
They have you, okay.

We're going to pull it up right on the beach.
Pulling up on beach?
Okay.
Pulling up on beach now.

Do you say we're here?
Okay.

Bye-bye.
