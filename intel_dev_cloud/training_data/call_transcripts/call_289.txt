911, what's the address of your emergency?
Hi, 1-3-13-Ester Drive, Boulder City, Nevada.
Okay, and what phone number are you calling from?
259, 8-9-9-79.
And what's the problem? Tell me exactly what happened.
My name is Hans Walters.
I worked for Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department.
I just shot and killed my son, Max, and my wife, Michelle,
and I killed her because she's in such chronic pain from her neck and back,
and on more medicines than she's not going to survive.
And we were both seeing a therapist and a psychologist in Boulder City.
His name is Jay Summers, and I feel terrible for doing it.
Okay.
And you...
You don't help. Please don't interrupt me.
Please.
I've also set the house on fire, and if the fire department comes to my house,
there's a fire hydrant right in front of my house, I'm going to open fire on them,
so I have to wait until the house is burning, and then I'm going to shoot myself, okay?
Okay, sir?
I don't ask me any question.
This is real.
This is a joke.
The fire alarms in the background is because I set the garage and the bedroom on fire.
My wife's in the bedroom.
I shot her in the head.
My son, unfortunately, is a more than there. I'm watching Oswald, and I shot him in the head, too.
And, uh, oh, forgive me for my sins. Please don't call back. Thank you.
