What's the address of emergency?
What's the problem there?
Somebody just came in my house.
What did they hit her in the head with?
I have no idea.
Other than you being stabbed in the chest, is there any other thing like?
I mean, stabbing the chest in the leg.
Okay.
Do you let me know when the deputies are with you, okay?
Okay.
Are the deputies with you?
Yes.
Well, they're in here, but they went through the front door.
