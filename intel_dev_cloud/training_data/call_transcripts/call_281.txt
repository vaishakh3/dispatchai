Now we want a margin to do. What are you reporting?
He was tied up by Dorman.
I'm sorry?
This unit. We have been tied up by him. He was taken off with a Nissan Rogue.
Okay.
Three?
Yeah.
When did this happen? When did he go inside?
It was, we think he was actually here from when he left the truck.
We weren't using his unit.
It was never checked.
We came in this, and we were
fixing it up after a long-term rental,
so we didn't have it much out.
You guys were tied up?
Yeah, how about still?
Okay, and how long ago did he leave?
Let's see him.
Stay on the line, okay?
Yes.
We also have housekeepers on the property.
I don't know if they ever saw him.
he did anything to them or not with their part out.
Did he take your vehicle?
He took our keys.
What keys?
Nissan wood.
What color vehicle?
It's like a purpleish-moon color.
All the road drive.
It was just dark and control.
What's a making model?
It's a Nissan road.
Nissan what?
Lowe R-R-R-G-U-E.
What color clothing was he wearing?
I really didn't take notice.
He actually was keeping up from looking at him.
You're not sure?
And that he left about 15 to 30 minutes ago?
15 to 30 minutes, yes.
When did he tie you up?
Right before leaving, he tied us off.
He had pillowcases of our heads.
How long ago did he tie you up?
It was like 15 minutes to 30 minutes.
Okay, so this all happened today?
Yes, yes.
We're still tied up.
You're still tied up?
Yes.
Listen, I already have deputies being dispatched out there.
I'm just going to keep you on the line.
What is...
A BS.
And you didn't know what he was wearing.
Was he by himself?
Yes.
Do you know what he was wearing?
What are wearing?
This black clothes.
Black pants, red shirt.
I don't even remember if it was a T-shirt or a long-sleeve.
I don't know.
Who's there with you?
My husband?
We can...
Do you guys need paramedics?
Um...
Maybe.
Um...
Hey, can somebody get me met for that home invasion?
Hello?
I'm still here.
Okay.
Did he have any weapons on him?
How many did he have?
He had an automatic with a silencer.
It was a black one?
Yes.
Was he inside when you guys arrived?
Yes.
I'm pretty sure.
he's been here the whole time.
Do you think he's been there the whole time?
Yes, because it's been empty.
And I know from this know there was never any tracks up and down here, including this morning.
What time did you arrive there?
Um, we came in, well, we live here.
We live on the property.
This is one of our condos.
We have a, we have a dessert.
We came in, him, I don't know what time it was.
It was a little afternoon.
We came in to work on it.
We were going to work in here.
Did you guys see footprints
outside prior to going in your house?
No.
Anybody else other than you and your husband
that were tied up?
We were tied up in here.
I have my daughter who is doing housekeeping
and a housekeeper working outside of the housekeeper
the property, we don't know if they are okay.
Are you sure if someone's coming here?
I'm sure somebody's going.
We have several units on their way out there, ma'am.
I don't know.
I didn't take notice that it's yours among.
Do you hear deputies?
No.
We are in one of the back buildings.
You're in one of the back buildings?
Yes, upstairs in one of the back buildings. We have three back buildings in the middle back.
Well, I don't have any doors.
So three in Big Bear, right?
Yes.
If they can see 201 and 202 that is the front building, we're in the building behind it.
You're in the building behind what?
The units that say 201 and 202.
and the building behind that building.
You're behind building 202?
Yeah, that's close enough.
I don't know.
Would they have sirens on?
Oh, God.
Are you still there?
Hello here.
I'm going to keep you on the line until my deputies make contact with you.
Okay.
It's just hard to tell when the phone goes to sleep, you know.
We are right across from where the command center was all we've seen.
You guys are just across from the command center?
We're at right to all these days.
It's not there anymore.
From the prep house, at the golf course.
Did you guys just go up there today to check the property?
Yes.
We were too busy all weekend just coming here to work.
So you guys arrived there today?
Yes.
It's still like right with all our properties.
We just never came into this.
She's still there.
I'm still here.
I'm going to stay on the line with you until my deputies actually go in there and help you guys, okay?
Did I try to get the door open?
I'm sorry?
I'm not just fighting death store.
I thought maybe I could open it now or something.
It's locked, and I can't...
Oh, okay.
Sorry, it's locked.
We can't...
It's too hard to manipulate the way he has us tied.
Your husband's still tied?
Yeah, we both still tied.
I just got scooted over.
He left off the cell phone in a different room.
He left in here.
I don't suppose you could...
try my better self-condem exercise.
