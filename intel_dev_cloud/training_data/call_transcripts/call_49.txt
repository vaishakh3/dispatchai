Okay, please do something for it.
I'm in the closet.
Is your brother in the closet with you?
Yes, ma'am.
All right.
We ran into the closet as soon as we saw it,
and set the scenes we heard something.
Did he break the window or the door?
I don't know.
I just heard some door.
And then, like, I said, Raymond, run,
and we ran in the closet, I turned on the alarm.
I called.
They almost here?
Yeah, they're driving to you now.
Is that a house or apartment?
Is that a house or apartment?
Okay.
Big two-story house.
The alarm should be...
The alarm's going off.
They should hear it.
I don't know if they broke something, but I know I heard something go,
real loud so we ran.
I don't know if the alarm scared them off or was, but I broke a window and then I got scared.
I got scared.
I thought they had the windows down.
Sitting in front of your house or death in the street.
Some, could you get...
Are the police removed here?
Ma'am, tell me.
I'm scared.
I'm here.
Ma'am, tell me, okay?
As soon as they get here, please just tell us.

All right, I'll let you know.
The alarms get off, too, so the police should be here.
So now, I don't know.
I just do it.
Okay, what do I do?
Hold on one second, okay?
You can go ahead and go to the door because they're out there now.
So what if he's out with the one?
Hold on.
Do you know knocking on the door?
No, we're in the back far closet.
In the back part closet?
At the very back and house?
No, like, we're in the front of the house.
Okay, I just heard him not.
Okay, go ahead and go open the door.
Okay, will you stay on the room? Yeah, I'll stay on the phone with you to see, open the door.
Right, and hold my hand.
Hey, stay in the closet, okay?
Okay. Go back in the closet?

Mm-hmm.
Okay.
They're going to check around the house first, okay?
So if you hear somebody coming in, it's probably the place, okay?
Okay, I heard he's walking.
All right, you can go ahead and go to the front door now, and they checked everything.
