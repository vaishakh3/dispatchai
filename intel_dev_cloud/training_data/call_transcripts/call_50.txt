She'll be on the floor.
She'll be on the floor.
I'm going to tell you how to help deliver the baby, okay?
Okay.
Make sure all the clothing below her waist is removed.
Okay.
Okay.
Don't go later down.
All right, that's fine.
Getting her set up and lay down.
Are you there?
Yes.
Okay.
And what's your name?
You there?
No, I'm here.
Yes, I'm here.
Is your front door unlocked?
The back door is.
The back door is unlocked.
The back door is unlocked.
Can you still they're on their way?
Yes, they are on their way.
Just stay on the line with me, okay?
All right, make sure all the clothing below her waist is removed.
Okay, raise her head with pillows, but don't let her sit up or go to the bathroom,
even if she feels like she has to.
She feels like she has to.
Okay, and that's fine, that's natural.
Just tell her to, don't worry about it, just stay where she is.
Okay.
Okay, now I want you to get some dry towels and a blanket to wrap the baby in.
And get a string or a shoelace to tie around the umbilical cord after the delivery.
Is she pushing or straining it?
Is she straining?
Okay, tell her to not to strain.
Okay.
But there's a lot of blood.
Can you see any part of the baby?
at all?
No.
Okay.
There should still be some time left before delivery occurs, okay?
Reassure her about that, and tell her that helps on the way.
Okay.
Yeah, I'll keep your phone with her.
Okay.
I want you to take slow, deep breaths between each contraction, okay?
And if anything changes, tell me immediately.
Okay, so you do a little pain right now, but...
Okay, that's, okay.
Okay, just stay with the slow, deep breaths.
Okay, let me know what's going on, okay?
If anything changes from the contractions?
No, she's feeling a little more relaxed right now.
Okay, all right.
All right.
Let me know if she pushes or strains or you see any part of the baby.
Hey, where are you?
Karen, you there?
Okay, Blake's in the car.
So just go ahead and get them.
I'm trying to, I'm on the phone with neither one.
I'm at you deliver any baby and I don't.
Okay, she feels like she has to poop?
Yeah, just leave her where she is and get her to breathe through it.
We don't want her to push.
And that's part of it.
That's her feeling like she has to go to the bathroom.
That's part of feeling like she wants to...
Pardon me?
I'm starting to feel a little.
Okay, so the heads are coming out more?
Yes.
As the baby delivers, listen to me.
As the baby delivers, support the baby's head and shoulders.
and hold the hips and legs firmly.
But remember, the baby is going to be slippery.
Don't drop it.
Tell me what's happening.
You relax right now.
Okay.
But the baby says comes up through every time, so.
Okay.
We just want to make sure it doesn't come out too fast.
It's okay if it comes out.
I'm sorry?
Say again.
You say this is a shulase, right?
Yes.
Yes, you can, yeah, you can use a shoe lace.
Yeah.
But the shoe lace is for the umbilical cord, and don't pull on anything, okay?
Just going to let it naturally happen.
Is she pushing?
No, she's not.
All right.
Okay.
Is the baby coming out?
No, no, not yet.
I feel a black.
Okay.
When the next contraction comes and she feels the urge to push,
have her push hard to get the baby out.
Okay.
Okay, and it's going to his forehead.
You're saying the forehead?
Yeah.
Tell her to push hard.
And remember to...
I'm going to...
Oh, that's okay.
Tell her to push hard and remember to support the baby's head and shoulders
and hold the hips and legs and hold them firmly.
Remember it's going to be slippery.
Is there someone there that can go wave down the ambulance?
Yeah, my mother-in-law, yeah.
Okay.
Is she having a little bit?
contraction now?
She's relaxed right now.
What happening?
She's relaxed right now.
Okay.
What do you see?
It's just blood right now, but it's not.
Okay, she's about to push.
She's about to push?
Yeah.
Tell her to push hard.
You keep your hands there, support the baby's head.
Okay.
Tell her to push when she's got to go to the bathroom.
Okay, hold on, hold on to him, support the hips and the legs.
Don't drop him.
Is he out?
No, it's just ahead.
Just ahead, okay.
Okay, I need you to talk louder.
The head's out, but the shoulders aren't yet.
The head's out, but the shoulder's out.
In fact, the paramedics are there, okay, but you just focus on what you're doing right now.
now.
Okay, got the baby, but...
Support the head.
Okay, is the whole baby out?
Yes, yes, okay.
Okay, is it a boy or a girl?
It's a girl!

What does?
I hear her crying.
Hello, hello, we got a baby.

Yeah, the paramedics are there.
Are they looking at you?
What's that?
Are they standing there in the room with you?
Yeah, they're right here.
They're old mobility.
Okay, congratulations.
Thank you.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
