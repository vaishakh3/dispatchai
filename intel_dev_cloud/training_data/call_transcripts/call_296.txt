I'm sorry, you said his black male, what color?
Yellow shirt and black and green shorts.
Did he take the thing?
I don't know.
I'm sorry.
He's gone.
I knew it was him that was surfing in and they had a new hall.
I think they were still from my house.
I see the saw out.
I don't know what he's done with my phone.
Um, he said he was calling the police.
Hey, you don't see your fault?
No, I don't know if he really called you or not.
That's why I got my cell phone and called.
He wanted my cell phone.
Did you see which way they went?
Um, we moved on a little coli-sac at the end.
Please hurry.
Yes, ma'am.
I got a minute in the route.
Thank you.
Stay on the phone, me, okay?
I'm sorry about this, Ms. Wilson.
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.
That's been the child and I'm disabled.
It's going to be all right.
And you don't see your phone?
Ma'am, do you see, you don't see your phone?
No.
No?
No.
All right, and you said they were in the U-Haul truck, correct?
Yeah.
Female is white.
You said what?
The female was white.
Your female was white.
And this just happened.
It's just happened.
It's going to be all right.
Wait, two, three minutes ago.
It's going to be all right, man.
He said he wasn't going to hurt me, but he didn't know where his brother was.
He didn't do what?
He didn't know where his father was and someone told him, bring $100 to get his brother
and he said he didn't be in any trouble.
Okay, did he look to be a young male, a young, young male, older male?
Young male.
Okay.
Were you upstairs or were you in your room?
I was in my bedroom with the door.
So it was locked.
I had gone back to sleep.
I didn't play last night and with my two dogs.
Okay, so you was in your room and then he came and entered your room, correct?
Well, I kept hearing a baby in the house.
And I knew my husband was at home and when they got up to me, he was in my house.
And he just said, where's my brother, you have my brother?
And I said, son, I don't know what you're talking about.
And he said, someone called me and told me I had to get here and get my brother and bring $100.
I said, that wasn't me.
And I said, I did your brother.
Okay, and he said, I don't know, and he said, I don't want to get in trouble.
No, I don't know if he's got a record or a war-held or something, but when I saw the U-Ha,
I knew immediately their intentions that was done, especially since I broke down two doors.
Mm-hmm.
And he walked off through the house, and I don't know.
I just got it.
Okay, it's going to be all right, this was going to be okay.
Just hope that they catch the guy in the...
Oh, no.
He asked me somebody for guys, and I only had about $5 so I gave it to him.
But they said, well, let's make sure your brother's okay, if there's someone we can call.
And she said, I'm calling the police, but I don't know if he really called you, right?
I doubt it.
And that's why I went in the bedroom and said you was a cell phone, and I thought I'd better call you just to make sure he'd really call.
I didn't know what their intentions was.
We got the K-9 in route.
The K-9 should be there within very short.
I'm sorry about this now.
I don't know how I ran any doing this happened before.
It's just so why they would have come here.
Some of the other houses around, I wouldn't have to do that to anyone.
But cars were in the garage, so they looked like no one to tell.
Yeah.
And the fact that I didn't hear the banking for a while.
You didn't hear the who?
The baby.
The baby?
The baby is breaking down of the door.
Oh, okay.
Yes, sir.
My bedroom was on the other side.
Is it like a one-way, like a, like a, what you say, is it like a one-way-in, one-way-out type of thing?
No, it's a garage door.
I have a front door, a back door, and a garage door.
So, like, the neighborhood, the neighborhood, is it, like, the one way?
Like, if you come out of your codicycle.
Oh, yeah.
You turn in West Lake Farm.
Uh-huh.
Hello.
You can't get a little left.
And you go all the way down.
A couple miles.
I'm the very last tiny little street on the right,
Halea Park Lane.
Can you say he was in a U-Haul? Was it a big U-Haul?
It was a decent size, probably, probably they're small as a big truck.
And she was blonde and that is tubby, and he was very thin.
You said he was thin?
He was thin.
and she was white and tubby with short blonde hair.
And I did some water.
And I said, you need to calm down, let me get you something to drink.
So he was thin with blonde hair or yellow shirt, correct?
Yellow shirt.
And he had on black and green pants, correct?
Now his hair was black.
His hair was black.
Female hair.
was blonde and short, and she was a little cubby, and she was white, and he was black, very thin, and very educated.
I mean, I hope his daughter's okay, but why did he, and then he denied that he broke into my house.
He said, someone else did it.
Right here.
Of course I have the alarm on.
Yes, huh?
Yes.
Okay now.
Oh.
It's going to be alright.
I don't know what to do.
I don't know if I should stay here with my dog and put somewhere else.
Look, if my door will work, if it will lock.
Yeah, just don't touch it, okay?
I'm gonna make sure they get caught.
Oh, if it's a true story.
I mean, I don't know who else could have been here breaking down my house.
Yes, no.
The minute, baby, do you stay in the bedroom.
My dog is...

He walked all around it.
I heard him.
I have some...
