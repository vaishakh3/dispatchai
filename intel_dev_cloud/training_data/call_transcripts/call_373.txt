Yes, I am on Hoth Road.
I am in water, and it's taken me away.
Okay, ma'am, we're on the way.
You're at Hough Road and where?
I'm right in the middle of Hoth Road.
What's the nearest crossway, do you think?
I just want to show them the closest place to where you're going to be.
Um, Summit Estates Drive.
Okay, stay on the line.
What's your name?
Erica Strickland.
Okay, Erica.
Please, please, hurry, ma'am.
Help on the way.
Are you the only one in the car?
Yes, and my car's starting to flood.
Okay, all right.
They're on the way.
Please, please, try you.
Ma'am, it's coming in quick.
No, they're on the way, Erica.
Please.
What do I need to do, ma'am?
Well, right now, you can't do anything.
Your car died, correct?
Yes, ma'am.
Okay, all right.
Is there anybody else around?
No, no, nobody.
Okay, all right.
And what colors your vehicle?
It's gray.
Okay, stay on the line, stand.
Can I try and get out and get on my room?
Stand a line.
Stay on the line, Erica.
Stay in the line, okay.
We're getting help.
Stand in the line.
Please, hurry.
Erica?
Yes.
You're not going to the water, okay?
But it's coming in my forest.
Do not go into the water.
Erica?
Yes.
Are they, ma'am?
I don't know.
I know right now it's going to seem like a long time to you, okay,
but just try to take a deep breath.
Are they going to be able to help me?
Yes.
I just was trying to get home.
My husband's been in the hospital all night.
I was trying to get on his prescription.
Just hang in there, Erica, okay?
It's just you in the car, right?
Yes, ma'am.
Please hurry.
You're home.
Listen, don't get out of the vehicle, don't go through water, okay?
Yes, ma'am.
Okay.
Just please stay on the line with me.
I'm on the phone with you, okay?
I'm sorry.
I'm on the phone with you, okay?
Okay, yeah.
Please just don't get off the phone with you.
We're not getting off the phone, okay.
I just don't want to die, ma'am.
Ma'am, that's not going to happen.
You stay in the car.
How are they going to get to me if the road is flooded?
They have all kinds of ways to get to you, okay?
Yeah.
You sure I can't get out and get on my roof?
No.
Stay calm, okay?
Yes, ma'am.
Erica?
Yeah.
I want you to release your...
seatbelt if you have it on.
It's really, ma'am.
Okay, all right.
And unlock your door.
It's an automatic.
Is that okay?
But don't open the door.
Okay.
Erica, it's the sheriff's permanent.
Are you on the north or the south side of some of the States, do you know?
I am right exactly in the middle, right where you go over the little bridge.
Please, hurry.
Okay, well, they're on their way.
They're on the way, okay.
Let's see you, hurry.
Erica.
You need to tell me if the water reaches the bottom of your window.
It's at my window, yes.
Okay, the water is up to the window?
No, it's at my hood, but it's coming up to my head.
All right, let me know if the water is at the...
At my, my path and my window?
Yes.
No, it's not there.
Okay.

Your husband was in the hospital last night and you were getting a prescription.
Is that what you were doing?
Yes, I was getting him a prescription for Tidney Stone.
Okay.
And you had passed through there before and then you were coming back?
Yes, I had to go and get him his prescription.
He was getting bad pain.
I understand.
Have you called any, did you call him as well?
