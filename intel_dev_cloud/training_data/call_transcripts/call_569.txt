What's going on?
What's going to ask?
I can't understand you.

One person talking a guy.

I can't understand.
What are you saying?
I can understand where you're saying.
I could understand where you're saying, not the faster.

What's the fourth way in the background and they were saying?
What if the American Civic Association is on Tuscary and is someone shooting upstairs?
There's someone shooting?
Yes.
Shooting what?
I don't know.
I didn't see them, but we can certainly hear them.
Come in, come in, commit.
We're going in the video.
How many good shots?
Could you hear?
Oh, God, probably 15 or 20.
What's your last name?
