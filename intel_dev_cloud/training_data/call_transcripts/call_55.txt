Okay, I don't see the boat.
Because everything looks like to plop all here, that's why.
They're coming.
They're on their way.
It's only a matter of minute, oldest.
You gotta maintain your calm or it will drown.
You have two choices, live or die, and you're gonna live, you dumb bastards.
You're still with us, right?

We've got a blue jacket.
Blue jackets?
No, we lost the gas, me on them.
Oh, okay.
Lost the decoys.

Keep talking to them.
It's over, and we are going to live.
Okay? Hang on. I, yes, grab on. Grab on. I'm going to stand this and we're going to try to stand right here. We're making a fan now. God wanting to get dead. He's dead right now.
You better hear religion.
Are you still on the end of the treeline? You're fine. You're fine. I'm not going to let you go, buddy. I've got you. Hang on one.
Keith, Keith, he's still on the end of the president.
We're not tripping no more. I'll block the water for you.
Keith, you need to let me know where you're at there.
They're trying to find you.
Huh?
Keith, are you on the end of the tree line yet?
Still on the end of the tree line?
Hold on.
Just hang on with it.
We're not moving, and we're not going anywhere right now.

South of the...
South of the...
South of the landing.

Do you see...
Can you see any houses looking straight ahead, Keith?
Are they in the east side or the west side of the lake?
We're on the east side.
East side.
You see the farmhouse on the south side of that tree line with that dog.
With that dog.
Southside is the farmhouse?
