Unified Police Department, this is Charlie.
Hi, I haven't had some problems with my 15-year-old son, Sean, at 3845 Westgate Circle and Magna.
Okay, you know, 3845 Westgate Circle?
Yes.
All right, is this the house for an apartment?
Yes.
All right, what's going on?
I don't know where he found his dad's fault through fast, but I don't know, I don't, I don't, I hope it's not, aren't anything under it.
And he's saying he's breathing so he didn't hurt us.
And I've tried to explain to him that we've had enough drama and problems in our lives,
and he's starting to run away.
You don't know if he hasn't gone, is that way, sir?
I don't know.
There were weapons in the home?
I thought they were all locked up, but he's telling me that he found one.
Oh, my God, he's holding it.
What?
You're not going to your sister's room.
Get out.
All right.
Sure is?
Hang up so fast.
Get out.
Okay.
Where's here right now?
He's in his sister's room.
What's his, what's a gun?
Yes.
Yeah.
What's his name?
Sean, and he's leaving.
He's got a big black little trash coat on.
How old is he?
15.
Sean is on.
Is he leaving outside?
Yes.
Which way, Sean?
He needs to stay out on the front floor.
Sean, give me the gun.
Sean, you're going to get in a lot of trouble.
Give that to me.
What's wrong with you, Sean?
Sure!
Can you go outside?
If you think that he's going to pull on,
and he has a gunner's, and you need to go to the house.
He's out in my driveway.
He's heading around to the circle.
He looks like he's getting ready to go.
Where?
Where he's going?
He's going straight.
What direction is that?
South.
What's the way?
He's got a big little other trash party.
He put on a ski mask.
He's got black clothes.
He's going west.
Yeah, that's to be masked?
Yeah.
He's heading west.
And is he wearing the bolt process?
Yes.
I can't take this.
What kind of gun is it?
It's a quart 45.
A cult 45?
Yeah.
And I don't know a lot about it as well.
That's a handgun.
Not coming back this way.
He's coming back to your house?
No, it looks like he's going.
Okay.
I'm going to turn to you over to the dispatcher, okay?
That's taking the normal call.
Okay.
Just one second, okay?
So she's going to ink you all that, and then I'm going to give you to the dispatcher that's just
after the officers over to your house, okay?
Okay.
Where's the right now?
Okay, he's just put his west house to Overson's house.

This is she.
Hi, I need you just get out here as soon as possible.
I have several officers in route at this time.
Okay?

I don't know what he's going to do.
She's sorry about picking a lot to the storage room and I don't know if that's true or
you guys have a gun and I have no idea to have exploded.
We've got their water around with a gun and as the weather tracks caught in the ski mask.
Okay, hold on just one moment.
Like I said, I have several officers who are out will be there shortly okay.
I'm just going to keep you on the line.
And I have the officers that are on my hair right now, okay?
Did he make threat toward you guys?
Okay.
Did he have any other weapons when he left?
That's what I know.
Yes, you have the first one.
Okay.
The judge is to do all security and that's where he had that.
Okay.
