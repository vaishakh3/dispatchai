Tita Valley to such.
Hi, my name is called, because I'm on my way to work going north down on Redwood Road.
Right around just a little south of the Harvest Hills area on the website.
of Redwood, I was going to walk in the Walmart area in a red shirt, but he was carrying
a samurai sword.
How many minutes ago was this?
Oh, left to five.
And he was on the west side of the road?
Yep.
Just like if they walked in, it looks like in the direction of Walmart.
Jim, how old did he look?
Youngish. Between 20 and 30 somewhere.
What race, Lizzie?
He can start this in, so I don't know if you was black or Polynesian.
About how tall Lizzie?
It's hard to say, but not overly tall. I'm just a six feet.
About how much any weight could you tell?
It's fairly skinny.
I'd say probably 150, 150, 150.
What color hair did he have?
Black.
It was kind of half-o-style, but it was kind of pulled back a little bit,
like a giant bun on the back of the head.
And you said he had a red shirt and what color pants?
I didn't know what it was a fan.
Okay, hold on one second.
All right. And your name, sir?
Got a phone number and I'll start you out.
All right. We'll go ahead and get this out to an officer, and we'll have them go check the area.
If they have any questions, they will contact you by phone.
Sounds good. Thank you.
You're welcome.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
