County 911 what's the address of the emergency?
That's your address.
We had several police hired earlier and did a report.
They told him to stay away from the house in jail tomorrow because we were going to go file with the magistrate and to call 911 if he came back.
I don't know if he left or if he's no.
What's his name?
The front door now and he's trying to get in.
What do you mean he's trying to get in?
Is he pulling on the door or?
Yes, yes.
He's hanging on the door.
Trying the doorknob.
He just went from the back door to the front door.
The cops listen to ma'am.
I'll put you on hold for just a second so I can get somebody started your way, okay?
Okay.
Ma'am, are you still there?
Yes, we're trying to get in.
Okay.
He's threatening to break in and kill me.
Okay, all right.
We've got him on the way, but I need to know if he's still outside the residence, though.
Yes, he's still outside the residence.
He's on the back porch.
He's trying to get in now.
Now he's going around to the front door again.
Just stay on the phone with me, okay?
Permission to defend myself to the floor, please.
What is your name, ma'am?
Keep the doors locked and we're getting somebody on the way.
He's dang on the windows.
Okay, we've got him on the way.
Just stay on the line with me.
He's on the back porch.
Watch you're on.
Dhing, please,
brain,
ding.
No, son.
Sack my stuff.
Stop this start.
He's trying to break in.
Oh.
I can't.
Just leave it lost if you can and leave the doors as secure as you can, okay?
I'm trying to get his elderly mother into a safer area.
He's very, I think he's very inebriated.
He's going around the front door again.
Or one of the windows open.
Oh, he's in the house.
Oh, he's in.
Oh, hold on this.
Oh, hold that.
Don't you, ah, Jay, they are.
Is he in the house?
Jay, you know what?
He's he in the house.
Oh, God.
He's he in the house.
He's got nice.
Oh, God.
No, no.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Ma'am, can you tell me if he's inside the house?
If he got in the house, she was in a tight.
Oh, she's stabbed him.

She doesn't do them 70, 7 o'clock.
I don't know.

I'm trying to put some pressure.
