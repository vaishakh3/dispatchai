And here, what I do?
People are police.
It's over.
And my way up here already,

Please don't let me kill myself.
Sir, I'm not.
If you tell me, what are you are?
I will come out there long as I know that you'll be
and I don't see the police.

Are you listening?
Yes?
The dispatcher team.
Nothing to my hand?
Not at all.
I'm gonna let them know you're coming out.
Okay, please.
Just let me know you got them in control,
and I'm gonna do everything from the TikTok first
so let you know I'm surrendering.
I swear to God.
I don't have nothing to leave.
Tell you the truth,
I'm going on there right now with the guns in my chin.
I won't do nothing.
All these are YOU going to let me hit him?
The teacher has told me
yes, to tell you to put your hands up in the air
and have nothing in them and come out.
Uh, this is all right.
I won't get butt-necked.
You know what I'm trying?
There's no need for you to take your clothes off
unless you want to take all your clothes off.
I'm sorry.
