Very Paramedics Operator 36, what is the address of the emergency?
I don't know what the address is, but right, it appears to be south of the 118 and, like, Canoga or Topanga, a big plume of plaque smoke.
So it's Canoga Boulevard and the 118?
I believe so. It looks, or it might be in between the Canola and Topanga.
The 118, the Ronald Reagan, on the Los Angeles side.
Okay, so that's, I believe so.
Yes, it is. This is Seamy, Sealy.
Oh, it's the Sydney Freeway?
I don't know.
Okay.
I'm not seeing anything in that area.
So you see some black smoke in that area there?
Right.
I just saw a big plume of black smoke just like...
Oh, okay.
You know what?
Oh, here we go.
Looks like we got a big traffic accident, maybe.
Owens' mouth?
Yeah.
Olin's mouth looks more like what would be...
Oregon and Renaldi and Kenoga.
It looks like it's below the freeway almost.
We're getting a number of calls on it, but it doesn't...
I don't know.
Yeah, that's what it is. We got a bad traffic accident there with fire.
All right.
Yeah, Metro...
Okay, ma'am, please calm down.
You are not involved in the accident.
All you can do is please help.
Yeah.
Okay, okay.
I got people on the way!
Okay, ma'am.
Hold on, okay.
Hold on a minute.
I got 911 on the way.
We're going.
Okay.
Ma'am, is that a train versus another train or train versus the vehicle?
Yes, train versus another train.
People are bleeding and hurt here.
Stay with me online, ma'am.
Okay.
Ma'am, we're already on the way there now.
I want you to stand the line with me, okay?
I will.
Okay, listen closely.
The fire department and the police are on the way there now, okay?
If I want you to, what I want you to do, if you're going to want to stay there and help,
please do not let anyone get close to that train, okay?
Okay.
If you see people jumping out or moving out of that vehicle, you can assist them to get out of any danger, okay?
Okay.
But do not get close to that fire, okay?
Okay.
If we don't want you to hurt yourself as a good Samaritan that you're helping,
please don't put yourself in any danger, okay?
If you feel like you can help someone, you can go ahead and do that,
but do not put yourself in danger, okay?
Okay.
And if you can, you make sure that if your car is used to block that intersection
or you cannot move it, you're willing to stay there, don't move your vehicle.
Okay, okay?
We don't want anyone to get close to that intersection, okay?
All right.
The police is on their way, and I'll also get the Department of Transportation over there, okay?
Okay?
Okay, now are they coming to my house?
Are they coming to the train at?
They're coming to your address, but they will see the train right there.
Okay?
I've got him on now.

We were up here on our campus.
We haven't been down there yet.
We just called.
Okay.

Okay.
All right.

The MetroLink train and the freight train collided.
The MetroLink train has derailed.
There are people screaming.

Brian Paramedadon 58, what's the address of the emergency?
Yes, I'm on the MetroLink train.
We just left North Ridge, I mean, Chathmore Station, heading towards Simi.
We had a collision with something.
We had a whole bunch of people who are now bleeding and on the floor.
Is that train?
It's a MetroLink train.
Okay, can you give me an intersection or something close to...
Well, almost at the first tunnel going into towards Ceeby Valley.
towards Seamy Valley?
Yeah, we're on the Metro Link train.
We just left the Chatsworth station.
Right, but you're at the...
We're heading towards Seamie Valley.
We just collided with something.
I don't know what.
But I have a lot of...
I've got several people who are injured in bleeding.
Okay, but are you in Seemey Valley now?
No, we're not.
We are real close.
We're just at the end of Chatsworth, probably.
Tell them we hit a freight frame.
Okay, hold on a second, ma'am, okay? I mean, sir, hold on. Don't hang up.
Okay. County Fire. You guys don't handle Seamy Valley, though, right?
Don't wait. Hold on.
Who's Hills Academy? I'm sorry, you're where?
I bet we're right out next door to the Chapel Academy. Okay, uh, there we go.
Is that like either Lee Lane and Dora, San Brando, somewhere out that way?
Yeah, somewhere out that way.
Hold on.
All right.
Sit down, sit down.
Yes, we have it at Heather Lee Lane and Dora.
Yeah.
Okay, we have the unitary on the way.
Do you know how many people are hurt?
Well, I can see about seven or eight people in the one car I'm in that are bleeding and on the floor.
Okay. Hold on a second, okay, don't hang out.
Yes.
I want.
Are you hurt?
I'm on the phone with 9-1-1 right now.
Sorry, to get people.
We hit a freight tray, but it looks like.
Yeah, we did hit a freight train.
I can see it.
Sit down.
You're bleeding in a.
Okay, sir?
Yes.
All right, we have paramedics on the way, so they should be there very soon.
Can you tell me how many people are hurt?
Well, I do one, two, three, those are probably mine.
Uh, four, five, six.
That's just on your cart?
That's just in my side of the car.
Okay, how many cars are there on the MetroLink?
Uh, there are three cars on this particular, uh, train.
Okay, all right.
Can you tell me if anybody is unconscious?
Um, I can't tell you.
I don't see anybody unconscious right here.
All right.
Well, I just see one who might be.
Okay.
I see one who might be.
Try not to move anybody around unless it is absolutely necessary.
We're telling them to stay still.
Okay, if there's any bleeding with a clean cloth or a towel?
Yes, there's several people bleeding.
Have a clean cloth or a towel and apply firm pressure directly on the wounds until we get there.
Okay.
All right.
We'll see what we can do here.
So we're trying to get people out who can move.
Okay.
We should be there soon.
I just need you to stand the line that when you hear the fire trucks.
I want to make sure that we can.
Right.
Okay.
We're going at the right direction.
Yeah.
Okay.
Who's at the screaming?
That's a person who's in a wheelchair who flew down the stairs from the top down to the bottom.
I see.
Is anybody getting to her?
Um, well she's, she's on her back in the wheelchair.
I don't know that she's injured.
She's just strapped in.
I see.
Hold, I want to see if I can get to this deputy who's on the station.
Okay.
Hey, can you get the deputy for me?
Sir, can you get the deputy for me?
Can you ask anybody there, is there anywhere near Santa Zuzana Pass?
Well, we're close to Santa Susanna Pass.
We're probably a little east of it.
Okay.
And we're at the right direction.
There's a big greenfield before.
Santa Zana Pass? Is it a park?
I don't know.
Okay.
There's some type of a park there that's on the, as you make the churn, you were making the
turn towards the first tunnel in Jamie Valley.
Okay.
Let's see. I'm going to try and get, see if I can get off the train right here.
Okay.
See if I can hear the, anything.
Are you heard, sir?
My elbow feels a little funny, but nothing serious.
Oh, shit.
That last car is almost virtually destroyed.
The back, a car?
Back, okay, they're telling us to move back as if possible,
possible fire onto the other train.
Here, can you?
Okay.
No, I don't want to hit you by the way.
No, okay.
But they're telling us move back because it might be a possible explosion from the freight train.
Okay, you said the back car is pretty much mangled?
It's complete, looks like it's completely destroyed.
I bet you you're going to have a lot of fatalities there.
I do hear sirens right now.
Okay.
Let me know when you, as soon as you start seeing fire trucks.
Yeah.
I don't think I'm going to go in it first.
No.
Okay.
Do you want you to sit down here then?
I'll help you.
I do.
I hear them.
I haven't seen, don't see anybody yet.
Don't see anybody yet, huh?
No, but I do see, I do hear them.
It should be coming up pretty cool.
There's a lot of people who are down.
Okay.
But nobody has anybody gotten into the car that's pretty much damaged?
There's nobody up there, but just looking at that car, it is...
Looks pretty bad.
It looks real bad.
It looks real bad.
It looks real bad.
Okay, somebody's on scene.
Now they're giving us for other information.
Okay, it looks like there's fire spreading towards the train and towards here.
They want us to help get people off the train.
Okay.
We have our units on C now, so if you can, help other people without hurting yourself any further.
Right.
See if you guys can get out to a safe area.
Right.
Okay.
Okay.
We should have our...
I'll have to close, turn this off so I can help out.
That's fine.
Go out and take care of yourself, though.
Okay.
All right.
Thank you, sir.
Bye-bye.
Come on.
