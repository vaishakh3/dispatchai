Hi, this is a state.
I got a call at 818 East Main Street.
I believe it's going to be, it looks like Rockford Lowell PD on this goofy map I have here.
Okay, so is that in Lowell?
I don't know.
I have 818 East Main Street, and then it came up southeast.
It's not in the city of GR.
I already called them.
I had a hysterical female screaming, get the police here.
Do you have a phone number, or is it just a cell phone?
I have 231.
That's a home phone?
That's the number that came up.
Okay, 231 area code is not even our county.
I know.
I don't know.
The other one I have is 616, so we can get anything out of her.
Okay.
I'm not sure what you want me to do with it.
If you don't know what city it's in, I don't know what it's done.
Well, I'm telling you, it's Rockford Lowell.
That's what I told you.
That's what it came up as.
That doesn't tell me what city, Rockford, Lowell.
Oh, my partner has her.
Is it what are you getting?
Tell me it's Rockford Lowell.
Ambulance doesn't tell me what city it is.
Lowell.
Isn't there a city Lowell?
Yeah, I asked you that, and you said you didn't know.
So it is in Lowell?
Yes.
Okay.
We don't dispatch for Lowell. They do their own dispatching.
Okay, thank you. Yep.
