And to no avail.
Okay.
We drank tonight to the, and we talked about it,
this will all come out, there's no doubt.
My wife is now dead.
Okay.
And I killed her.
There is no argument or dispute about that.
Okay.
Okay, and was it a mutual decision or was it your decision to do it?
We talked about it.
Okay.
She said she could not give me any promise of cure for alcoholism.
Okay.
She is 51, I am 78, I am our sole and only caregiver.
And I told her.
But I just couldn't do this anymore.
Okay.
I have not, I'm not denying anything.
This is, this is it and all.
I put a pillow over her face.
And she didn't feel any pain because she was chronicly,
an alcoholic and drunk, and I held it, and I held it,
and I held it until I called you.
Kevin, Kevin, get the hell away.

Get the police here as quick as you can.
Are they on the way?

Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm not trying to deny anything, sir.
Get the police here, please.
They're on their way.
Sir, who am I speaking to?
Burke.
There is no point in us.
You and I carry on a conversation.
What is done is done.
Okay, I appreciate you.
We are on the way.
We will be here.
Okay, and that's your son, Kevin?
That's there in the background.
That's my son-in-law who rush to try and give us.
CPR. And I made sure that she was gone before I made the phone call.
Okay, did your son-in-law live there or what?
I'm sorry?
Did your son-in-law live there as well or what?
No, he lost one from work. He's a shift worker.
Okay, so why, did you call him as well?
No, I didn't. I called my wife's daughter from my previous marriage.
Okay.
She called her husband, Kevin.
But there is really no need for us to continue this
If the authorities will run their way
What is done is done
Okay
