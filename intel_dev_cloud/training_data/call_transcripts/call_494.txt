9-1-1-Uperset, a plane has just crashed into the Hudson River.
U.S. Air, Big D.C. 9 or 10 has crashed into the Hudson River.
About, oh my gosh.
Oh, my God, it was a big plane.
I heard a big boom just now.
We looked up and the plane came straight over us and it was turning.
Oh, my God.
What's your name, sir?
All right.
Sure as I called you, the plane disappeared out of the side.
I guess because of the buildings.
I can't.
Was it a large or small plane or what?
It looked like an airbus plane, like a big plane.
All right, sir.
Oh, my God.
You're going to be there for the police at East 199 Street.
Yeah, I'm right here.
I'm right here.
Stay right there.
I'm sending everybody, okay?
Okay.
Wow.
Now I want operator 2194.
Yeah, I'm witnessing an airplane is going down.
It's off fire on the left night.
Where?
It's drunk. It's turned it. I don't know where he's going to fall, though.
Where are you, sir?
Oh, my God. Where are you?
Where are you?
Avenue on 1-99.
