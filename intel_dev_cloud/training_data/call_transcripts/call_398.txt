Yes.
Well, I'm locked in my car.

Yes, in my car.
Where are you at?
I'm in Woodenvale on Avondale.
How would you be locked in your car?
Well, what happened is I got in my car and I turned on the ignition and everything died on it.
Okay.
And you can't just manually open your door?
door?
No, I can't open my door.
I am actually locked in here and my windows are locked.
All right.
And did you try the passenger door to see?
No, hang on.
Oh, thank you.
I have no idea.
Oh, my worry.
I'm so scared.
Okay, no problem, ma'am.
How did you know that?
I'm a 911 operator, so it happens.
All right.
At least I can get out of here.
Okay, so much.
