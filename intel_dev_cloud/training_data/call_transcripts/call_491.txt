911, this is Bill. What are reporting?
We're having a baby, and we're in Boulder Creek. We need to get the Sutter.
Okay, what's the problem to me exactly what happened?
My girlfriend's going into labor, her contractions, or three to five minutes apart, or a little bit closer.
They're closer.
Okay.
And she's getting pushing feelings. I just called Sutter. They told me to call 911.
Okay. Are you with her now?
Yeah.
Is she conscious?
Yeah.
And is she breathing?
Yeah.
Okay.
Just a moment.
How many weeks pregnant is she?
Uh, nine months.
Is the baby completely out?
Is it what?
Oh no, it's still in.
Okay, that's good.
Yeah.
Can you see any part of the baby now?
You stand in line here.
I'm going to get help going for you right now, and I've got more instructions for you.
But you stand in line while I dispatch the paramedics.
Okay.
You're not going to hear me for a second here, but just stay on the line, okay?
Okay, that's fine.
I'm going to grab mine.
One second.
Okay, I've got paramedic.
I'm sending the paramedic.
I'll stand in line to tell exactly what you do next, okay?
Okay.
Do not try to prevent the birth.
Yeah.
Tell it to do not sit on the toilet.
Okay.
Allow her to assume the most comfortable position and have her take deep breaths between contractions.
Okay.
Keep breathing, huh?
Deep breath.
Do you have an ETA?
Just a couple minutes, okay?
Okay.
I'm going to stay in line with you here.
Okay, so there should be still some time left before delivery occurs.
Reassure her that helps on the way.
Have her take slow, deep breath between these contractions.
She is.
She's doing good.
I'll know what, honey.
Is she feeling the need to push?
Are you still feeling the need to push on it?
Just when the contractions come.
And then she's having another one.
Okay.
Teller, we're coming with lights and sirens, but I need you to do that for me.
You're coming with lights and sirens.
There still should be some time left before delivery occurs.
Help is on the way.
I would take slow, deep breath between each contraction.
Okay.
If anything changes, tell me immediately.
I'm going to keep you on the line here until they arrive, okay?
Okay.
All right.
I see crowning.
As the baby delivers, support the baby's head and shoulders.
and hold the hips and legs firmly.
Remember that baby will be slippery.
Don't drop it.
Okay.
You're doing really good.
Just let me know if you see any crowning again, okay?
Okay.
You're not going to hear me for a second, but I'm right here, okay?
Okay.
Okay.
How's you doing?
The ambulance is across the street.
You're on the wrong side.
Okay.
He's having a contraction.
The baby's crowning.
they're on the wrong side of the street
they're on the wrong side of Highway 9
coming out
they're across the street they need to hurry
I already told them okay
it's coming out right now
as the baby delivers

support the baby's head and shoulders
and hold the hips and legs firmly
