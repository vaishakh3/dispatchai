Don't move her! Don't move her!
Lama, 911. What's the address of your emergency?
Oh, my God. I'm on 3rd Avenue, the railroad track.
Somebody just tried to jump on the train and sever her legs.
Okay. Third Avenue.
We're on the west side of the railroad tracks on 3rd Avenue, and hang on, at Atwood.
Do not move her. Don't move her! Don't move her! Don't move her!
Oh, my God.
Okay.
All right, I got an ambulance on the way for you, okay?
Hang on, I'm having a really hard time hearing you.
I'm sorry.
I'm also an EMT.
Okay.
Is that better?
I know.
I can hear you.
I'm in my car now.
Okay.
Where's the victim?
Don't move her.
I'm sorry.
Go ahead.
Where's the victim?
The victim is on the west side.
There was a railroad track.
We are at third and outwood.
Yeah, I got that.
Third and Outwood.
There were four individuals trying to jump onto the train.
One succeeded the other fell.
Okay.
I'm going to ask you some questions.
Okay.
I really want to get over there and try to help her.
Okay.
Go ahead.
Do you have a cell phone?
I want my cell phone right now.
If I go over there, it's going to be too loud.
Gotcha.
That's right.
Why don't we try to do that, though?
Because you can probably do more help than anyone else there if you're an EMT, okay?
Let me know when you're with her.
Okay.
They're on the way.
They've been on the way since we've called.
For one.
Okay.
Okay.
Do not, do not tourniquette.
Okay.
They're saying.
We're not going to put a tourniquet on her.
They're like, go get her up, you guys.
They're trying to stick her up.
Okay, no, we don't want to do that.
We don't want to move her.
I know.
Oh, no, I know.
I'm trying to tell her, you guys.
Just hold pressure as much as you can.
I'm on the phone.
Lay your head back, honey.
How old?
Oh, yes, I do.
There's another nurse on scene right now that works at the hospital with me.
Okay.
How old do you think she is?
Early 20s.
I will get right back to the victim.
I'm getting gloves for the nurse right now.
Okay.
Is she awake?
She's awake.
Is she breathing?
Is she breathing?
How old are you, honey?
She's 17 years old.
What is your name?
Her name is Anna.
Are you from Long Island?
Okay, here, here, here, here.
These are small gloves, but...
No, we're not.
I have a nurse on scene holding femoral pressure to one side.
The other one?
Do you want another glove?
Are you still there?
Yeah, I'm still here.
Is she completely alert?
Okay.
She is.
Hang on, hang on.
I'm trying, honey.
I'm trying, I'm trying.
I'm trying.
You're good?
Okay.
She's alert.
She's talking.
Now she's trying.
Don't move.
Don't move.
Okay, what part of her leg was amputated?
At the ankle, at the knee?
One is mid thigh on the left side?
Mid thigh?
Okay. You're moving my car. Thank you. Okay. Okay. So, left side, it's amputated right below the head. Is the amputated part still there?
Oh, sorry. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that right in your ear. Damn it. The other one, right legs. It's, um, looks like right below the knee. She got both legs. Okay. She definitely has both legs. Okay. She is lost. Are her legs still there?
Yes.
The left leg actually may not be, but the right leg definitely is.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
So we have two units unseen right now. I'm sure they already called in.
Yep. I've got them on the way, okay?
Okay, good.
If we can collect, without traumatizing her too badly,
if we can collect those amputated parts.
But it sounds like the train's still moving.
So if they're under the train,
we don't want to...
It's a really long train.
Okay, then we don't want to try that.
Don't tourniquet it too much yet.
Okay.
No, we're not going to do anything right now.
There are still quite a bit of people on the side of the road.
They're not moving because the train, obviously.
Gotcha.
No, no tourniquet, correct?
We do not have a tourniquet on?
No, we are not.
The officer on scene was just instructed not to do so.
Okay, that is correct.
Correct. Do not turn a kid, okay?
We actually have...
You have some claws?
I'm sorry, go ahead.
Do you have something that you can press against the part?
That I can what?
Press against the amputations to control bleeding.
Yes, yes.
What we do right now, they're holding femoral pressure on the left.
Okay.
The right side is they have like a T-shirt around it.
Right, that's fine.
Just add you.
You probably know, we don't want to pick that stuff up and check.
If it's soaked, you add more.
And continue femoral pressure.
Okay, we do.
We're keeping on femoral pressure.
We have a nurse on scene still.
Her friend is still here.
Fire and, yeah, two fire here now.
Okay.
I'll let you go then.
You talk to them, okay?
Okay, thank you.
All right, you're welcome.
Bye.
All right.
