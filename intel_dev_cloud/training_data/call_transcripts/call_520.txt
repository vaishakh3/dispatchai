On the highway.
Where on 35?
Like, a give or take, except mile 215, somewhere around there.

It took me a little bit to figure, before I to sink in,
that somebody hasn't jumped off my cab.
Okay.
The last place you remember was about the 215?
Like, I can't admit, I except the next thing that I could.
I could figure out.
Where did you exit off?
