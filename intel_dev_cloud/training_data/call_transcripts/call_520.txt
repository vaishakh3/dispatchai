Going south.
Towards San Marcus.
And you said you saw a body on the side of the road?
I could have, I mean, I was, like, driving at 60 miles an hour, but as I passed, I could just warn that I saw a body, like, right on the side of the road, and towards, like, the middle, median.
What did it look like, man, was it...
I mean, what I thought that I saw, it was, like, like, wearing face down with, like, a male with, like, dark hair, like, a white shirt.
And the median you said?
Yeah, you know, like, towards, uh, the concrete little medium between the highlights.

I was going 35 when he jumped.
Okay.
And, you know, it's somewhere between Buda or
Or Austin and where you're at now, right?
Yes.
It had to have been north of the 215.
No, I was going south.
He doesn't exactly know where it happened, but he's at H-EB right now.
He turned around to go back.
I'm going to go one more light, and then I'm going to turn around and see if I see him in the street.

No, 1.
So I'm a cab driver, and I'm driving this two guys to, so Marcus.
And one of the guys, I'm going through an hour, like 65-7.
And one of the guys jumps off the cabin, he goes in 6570.
What did he jump off?
On the highway.
Where on 35?
Like, a give or take, except mile 215, somewhere around there.
I don't know.
It took me a little bit to figure, before I to sink in,
that somebody hasn't jumped off my cab.
Okay.
The last place you remember was about the 215?
Like, I can't admit, I except the next thing that I could.
I could figure out.
Where did you exit off?
I don't know who I said, but I made a whole U-turn and call me this guy.
And I don't know what I thought is to call 911 from calling 911.
Hold on for you.
I think.
I can't fucking believe it.
And you're going southbound, right?
I'm going southbound, yes.
No right, yes.
Okay.
And where did you get off?
You don't know?
Did you get off at center?
Street or Yarrington?
I don't know.
I said it's freaking out.
Where are you at right now?
I'm trying to get back over there where he jumped off.
And the other guy that's with you doesn't know where he jumped off?
No, he goes off freaking out.
He can't put anything.
He, like, he jumped off.
Like, I saw him off.
The guy who he jumped off, what is he wearing?
Do you remember?
No, I don't know what he was wearing.
I just saw him.
He opened the door and he goes, where are you thinking, huh?
Like, uh, he knew him were going.
He knew who we were going to phone Michael, and he just jumped off.
Okay.
And me and my friend is freaking out.
Hold, there's a cop right here.
