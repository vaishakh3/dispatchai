Thank you all one.
I mean an ambulance.
Quick to stop for an end-night.
Oh my God.
And Antonio Fire.
Any masks?
How can we help you?
I'm getting an ambulance at 351 wayside drive.
351 wayside?
Yes.
It's a house.
It's an apartment.
Okay.
And what's going on?
What's the emergency?
I'm sorry.
What's the emergency? What's going on?
My sister has...
She has her child...
Hello?
Hello?
Tell me what's going on.
Don't talk to the other people.
Talk to me.
My sister has...
She's heard her child.
Seriously, her child.
How did she do that?
What's going on with the child?
The baby is dead.
She has...
What you say?
The baby is dead.
No one is the baby.
Maybe three weeks, not even three weeks old?
Three weeks old?
Not even three weeks old, P.
What did she do to him?
Smart for her home.
She stabbed him.
There's a guy all over the bed.
I don't know.
All right, ma'am,
you're going to connect you up to the police, okay?
Pay have the line.
You know, I come here.
All right.
Ma'am, where is your name?
My name is Petitor here.
Where is he concerned?
She said that, say that, I'm sorry.
Priscilla, where's your sister?
She's just sitting on the couch.
She's going crazy last night.
She was hearing voices.
She kept bringing me the baby and finally she calmed down and I took her back to the baby.
And then now I just woke up to her screaming.
Okay, how old is the baby?
Not even three weeks old.
She's too.
Your baby's dead.
The baby's getting beat.
Somebody called.
And they're on their wife, but they okay?
I need the keys so I can open the front door.
Oh, my God.
Ma'am?
Yes, yes.
Do not touch the baby.
Don't disturb anything in the area there, okay, right?
My mom, my mom was holding the baby.
My mom was holding the baby.
All right.
All right, ma'am.
Everybody's on the way to help you, okay?
Oh, I need to find the keys for the front door.
No, no, no, I see nobody's there, it's okay, baby, you can stay right there.
Is that your sister?
Yes.
Oh, my God, it can please.
Do you stand yourself?
Yes.
I'm sister. I told you to come to me.
I'm sorry, do you tell me that you got?

Yes.
Where does she stab herself?
In the heart and in the stomach she says.
No, no.
Where did she do you?
I see her stab wound in her on her heart.
You're just here?
I'm looking at her right now, yes.

Mom, I'm on me and I'm calling him right now.
I can call him right now.
Ma'am?
Yes, I'm going to go ahead and let you go, okay?
They're on their way.
All right.
And bye-bye.
