Hello?
Hello.
This is 911.
You have an emergency?
Yes, I think somebody's breaking into my house, please.
Okay, stay on the fine.
Why do you think someone's trying to break into your house?
I'm in the upstairs and I can...
They're breaking stuff down.
See here.
What's been broken?
It sounds like glass and I thought I...
Maybe to a window?
I...
I don't know.
You hear some glass being broken?
I did.
How long ago was that?
A minute.
10.30 seconds.
Okay.
Just stay on the phone.
Just stay calm.
I'm going to stay on the phone with you.
Are you the only one in the house?
I am.
Okay.
No children?
No.
You're an upstairs apartment?
I'm in upstairs.
I'm in upstairs.
In your bedroom?
I'm under a desk in the office.
Where, which area of the house did you hear of the glass breaking?
Kitchen.
Oh, please hurry.
Do you have any weapons in the house that anyone could use?
No.
Where is the kitchen at compared to the house?
The back side of the house?

Back side of the house by the pool.
Oh, God.
Do you have any dogs in the back?
No, nothing.
Didn't stand backyard?
Yes.
Okay, I have several officers coming that way.
Stay calm.
You're doing great.
Have any indication that you know that will be trying to get into your house?
Any ex-husband or ex-boyfriend or anything like that?
No.
Okay.
Just stay on the phone.
Do you hear anything else?
I don't.
Okay, I don't want you to move.
I just want to know if you hear anything else that we need to know about.
I hear something.
What do you hear now?
I don't know it's like I hear.
I'm so far away.
I can't tell.
Where you can't get it out?
Okay, just stay calm.
Just stay calm.
Just stay calm.
Oh my god, they're coming up to stairs.
They're coming up stairs.
You're calling up the stairs, Amy.
Call up the stairs on David.
Just stay where you're at.
You can hear someone call up the stairs?
With flashlights, baby.
With flashlights, baby.
Just stay flip where you're at.
You don't have to say it work.
They're behind you?
They're behind her in her bed, in her room.
She's in the same home she is.
Do you see them?
They're on your face?
Is it here?
Amy!
It's a good safety in front as I can hear something in the background.
Don't say word.
Don't say it word.
Don't say word.
Don't say word.
We are at your house.
Do not say word.
Do not hear a word.
Yep.
See, they follow the people, okay?
Don't say a word.
You're fine.
Don't say a word.
Just stay put.
Stay where you're at.
You still hear somebody in your house?
Was it more than one voice?
There were two.
There was at least two.
I don't know if they're chasing two.
She's not there if anybody's going to go in the house.
You're on.
Next time.
You've got to select
with the security
you can't stand for it.
Stay, just stay where you're at.
Don't leave.
Just, you don't have to say a word, Hunt.
Just stay where you're at.
I want you to stay quiet because I don't know
this guy up is still in the house.
We're changing somebody, but I want you to stay put.
Do not move.
The only time I want you to say someone is if they're coming towards you.
But other than that, stay silent.
I'm sorry?
Amy, are we looking for the C.P.?
She won't come on, let's I tell her.
They're clearing the house.
So you stay put.
They've got to get them, and everything, so I want you to stay put.
They're going to clear that whole house, make sure that nobody else is there.
When they're clearing the house and when they're dead, they're going to let me know they want you to step out.
But stay where you're at, huh?
You're doing, all right, you're doing the excellent.
Wonderful job.
I know, this will be a very scary thing, but you're doing fine.
Good.
All, ma'am.
Can I always say something?
Do they want her?
Amy!
Do they want her?
They're yelling.
They said, ma'am, I want to make sure that they...
Okay, okay.
You're with the officers, hon?
Okay, you go ahead and talk to them.
You did excellent.
Okay.
Okay.
You're with the officers?
He said he was going to check.
Okay, okay, then I'll stay on the phone with you.
I'll stay on the phone with you.
It's fine, it's fine.
And once I hang up, I'm sure they'll let you call your husband and let him know what's going on.
Take a deep breath.
I don't want you to hyperfinal anything.
Take a deep breath and breathe.
You're okay.
Now you're safe.
We've got oxygen in the house with you.
You okay?
They're still checking the house. I still have on TX them.
You're with them now?
No, the door's right off of the kitchen.
Go down the stairs right there at the left.
You okay?
Okay, take a deep breath.
They got there just in time, didn't they?
They were standing right there in front of you?
Uh-huh.
At your feet, huh?
Wow.
The office that you're in is that that's not your bedroom, right?
No, I'm in the office.
You were underneath the death?
Yes, just in the office.
And where were they at?
Standing right in front of the dust, ready to grab the computer.
Oh, okay.
So you heard them say, we get the computer?
I mean, they were, yes, they were doing.
They were undoing and everything?
And then what happened?
They were going to have to get under the computer to do it.
under the door.
Oh, okay.
And then what happened?
They heard something and they ran?
I heard the cops.
Yeah, for some reason they went out of the bedroom.
I don't know why.
I heard some guy say, I don't know what he said, but they walked out of the bedroom and then the cops hollered.
Okay.
You did awesome.
You did awesome.
I know there's broken stuff downstairs.
I don't know how they got in.
I don't know what they're doing.
That's okay.
That's okay.
I mean, that's nothing compared to, you know, us not getting there on time, okay?
And then never, ever, ever, ever, was like...
And then the first time they did, okay, what's your name, Hunt?
Did you happen to see what they were wearing at all?
The guy that was in front of the desk had on black tent or black, like their squishy sweatpants,
you know, those slippery sweatpants, you know, like the windbreakers?
Yeah, but they're very, very big, I can...
Black baggy pants?
Yeah.
And a really long, I can't, I don't remember, it was a great long sweatshirt.
What about the other girl?
Antenna shirt.
What kind of shoes are you?
I don't know.
Okay.
What about the other guy?
I didn't see, I don't know.
I don't know.
I couldn't see what he had on.
Are they still checking your house?
Yeah.
He must still be in the basement.
Okay.
While I'm on the phone with you, unless you're okay to hang up, are you not okay to hang up?
No.
Okay.
I just want to call my husband.
Okay.
So you're okay to hang up now?
Okay, okay, I'll let you go ahead and call your husband.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Oh, you were too.
Bye-bye.
