911 were reporting.
Hi, I apologize for this because I just called your number and it says that the
desk is closed so to reach a police officer, I had to call 911.
That's right, how may help you?
I would like for a police officer to give me a call.
Okay, and what are you reporting?
I just have some concerns about somebody that I know this in this area that is not feeling right for me.
Okay, and is this, are you seeing this from around your house?
This, well, I had a person that I met this summer that all of a sudden has showed up on my doorstep.
Okay, what's your home address so I can just stay in the right area and then I'll have an officer call you?
Are you being harassed?
No, I'm not being harassed.
No, there's just some concerns I have because you've got somebody with him and I'm not feeling comfortable about the whole situation.
Is he there now?
No.
That's why I want to talk to an officer about this, so maybe they can.
So, okay, I'm just to know what he's doing that's making you feel uneasy.
He's got a young girl with him.
He is 28 and she's like 15.
Okay.
So possibly, gotcha.
Yeah.
And what is your name?
Do you prefer contact on your cell or the home?
The cell number?
Yes.
Okay, I'll have an officer call you.
Thank you.
You bet.
