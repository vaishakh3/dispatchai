Now on the Indian Police Fire Medical Rescue.
Hi. I'm kind of sleep and this man knocking on my windows and trying to get into my house.
What city?
Tamarack, Florida.
What's the address?
7-160, South State Boulevard.
Do you know this person?
Yes, he's my ex.
Okay.
And he is now welcome to my house and he knows that.
And he's trying to get into my house, and he's not letting me or my roommates please.
He's knocking on my windows.
I've been telling him to me for the past hour, and he hasn't been listening.
Okay.
Is it the house an apartment?
It's like a villa.
Okay.
Is he white, black, a Latin?
He's Hispanic.
Hispanic now?
Yeah.
What's his name?
Mario.
Do you know what he's wearing?
Um, last time that I saw him, it was about three hours ago, he was using a black shirt and bleaking.
And I'm scared he might be violent.
What's your name now?
No, yeah.
He has a history of violence?
Yes, he does.
Do you know if he has any weapons?
No, man, he gets that. Not that I don't.
Oh.
Was that him?
Yeah.
Do you know that?
Yeah.
Sounds good.
He might like break his window.
My window.
Come up here.
He just came out.
Oh my God.
He just broke my window.
Okay.
Ma'am, they're out of my house.
I want to take it out.
Get out.
Okay.
Ma'am, is he near you?
Hello?
Is he near you?
Yes.
He just broke into my house.
Oh, God.
Really?
Can someone come out here, really?
Okay, ma'am, the call has already been entered.
Unless, I said...
Why should open his office?
Because, why do I want to open his office of you?
Why not?
No, you need to leave.
Why?
Leave.
Hello?
Okay, ma'am, I'm just going to stay on the phone with you.
No, no, no, no, let, leave.
You have a lot, oh, you have a gun now.
You're a knife, you're not.
You're a knife, but he's starving.
