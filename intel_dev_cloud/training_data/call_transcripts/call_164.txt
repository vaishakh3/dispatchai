Hello!
This is 9-1-1-1!
Okay, you need to stop screaming so I can hear you.
I need to get me right.
Oh my God!
What's the one?
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
Oh!
Oh my God!
The guy went on in the house.
My boyfriend did die!
He's, he's, he needs an ambulance, 911.
What's wrong with it?
What, what, 911?
Hey, ma'am, listen to me.
I need you to go down so I can understand what's going on.
What's wrong with your boyfriend?
What?
What is wrong with your boyfriend?
What?
All right, you need to come to, uh,
right away.
Hey.
Hey, listen to me.
I understand it's right now.
Stop screaming so I can understand you and send you help.
What's going on?
Calm down for me.
Take a deep breath.
What's going on?
Hurry.
Hurry.
You can't breathe?
Okay.
Listen to me.
Listen to me.
I'm going to transfer the paramedics.
They're going to give you CPR instructions, okay?
Don't hang up.
Don't hang up, okay?
I need to know what to do.
Listen to me.
I'm going to transfer. Don't hang up.
Baby, baby.
Oh my God.
No, no.
Oh, my baby.
Are you no fire department?
Open you with a transfer.
Oh, God.
This is the fire department.
What's the address of the first?
Come on!
What's the number you're calling me from?
What's your phone number?
What's your phone number?
What's my phone number?
Is it...
Yes!
Come quick!
Come, you can help him.
Baby, baby!
Oh my God, I don't know what to do.
Okay, help him.
Okay, why exactly what happened?
Right!
Just get somebody here quick!
He was shot in their head with a gun!
Oh my God, help!
Come quick!
Help, help, help, help.
Oh, look.
Okay, Ma'am, I'm sending the paramedics to you now.
Right away, right away, please, please, please.
He put a gond to his head, and he just let me do it.
He was joking, but boom, and one else, I go, honey, don't do that, I'm stupid.
And, oh, go, hold him.
Why aren't you coming?
Look at him.
Look at him.
Okay, helping him.
