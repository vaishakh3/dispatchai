don't try and tell me this for the best I'm not I'm not going to I called you guys
okay and and the reason you called and the reason I'm talking to is because I want to help you
I just wanted somebody to talk to you
And I didn't know who else was talking about it
Okay yeah
And you know what, you did the right thing
I will talk to you as long as you'd like me to talk to you
I want to get you some help too
Don't think that just because you call 911

They're going to try and get you turned in
And get you handcuffed
You are the police and actually
When they find me I am going to be handcuffed
Okay well I'm 911
And I'll tell you this
If you can do exactly what you're doing
on the phone right now and helping me
out, I will do everything I
can to help you out. So when you
do talk to somebody... But you can't do anything to help me.
Well, I want to do everything
that I can. What do you can't do
anything? What would you like me to do for you?
You
can't make me any better.
Hold on.
No weapons.
What colors the A-frame?
No weapons.
Yeah, no weapons.
Yeah, the officer.
asked if you had a weapon. They're concerned that somebody might get shot at or something
might happen. Yeah, I was just saying. Okay. No. All right.
Have they found my GPS location yet? I hear a little beep in the background.
No, that's the other phones ran. We have six different people that are working here answering phones.
