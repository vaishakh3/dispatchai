I don't know if anybody else is talking to any other operators.
I sure as hell hope so.
Yeah, there is.
We have a ton of calls right now.
But I'm going to keep you on the phone because you're inside the house.
Yes.
I'm with two other people, but they had nothing to do with it,
and they just, like, ran down here, like, kind of crawling back.
Oh, my gosh. Okay. Do you know your roommates?
Yes, I know every single one of them.
Okay. I don't want you leaving the room. You need to stay in there.
Hold on just one second, okay?
Okay. Sir, I want to know, I need to know exactly where you're
you're at the house where the officers can find you when they come in.
Okay, so there's two different ways to get through.
One is by the very back door.
There's another door that looks down in the basement where I ride by that door.
And if you're going through the house,
if you go all the way down stairs, all the way into the base,
there's a bedroom down there.
And if you go all the way back and just keep following it back,
there's going to be a sliding door that is really stuck,
and we're on here.
So you're in the basement, though?
Yes.
In the basement, in the back, in the back of the basement behind the sliding glass door?
No, there's no sliding glass door.
No, you're in the basement, in the back of it?
Yes, in the back of the basement.
It's set up like a mother-in-law.
There's a kitchen, a bathroom, a big bedroom,
and if the officers first walk through the door, they'll see a desk,
and if they take a left, they will...
They'll start heading toward the back where there's a bunch of computers.
If they slide back there, it's kind of skitties, they'll get to a place with the kitchen.
