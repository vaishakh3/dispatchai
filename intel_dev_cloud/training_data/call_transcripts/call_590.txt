Four or five people that are shot?
At least.
There's a, like, that's what I saw.
Okay.
It's really fucked up.

I think okay what do you have roommates in your home yes we I live a six there's six of us
total what did what is your first
Are you in your bedroom?
I am, like, hiding in a kitchen room there, unless nobody has seen.
There's in the basement.
Okay, so you don't know really what's going on now.
I can't see anything.
I don't know if anybody else is talking to any other operators.
I sure as hell hope so.
Yeah, there is.
We have a ton of calls right now.
But I'm going to keep you on the phone because you're inside the house.
Yes.
I'm with two other people, but they had nothing to do with it,
and they just, like, ran down here, like, kind of crawling back.
Oh, my gosh. Okay. Do you know your roommates?
Yes, I know every single one of them.
Okay. I don't want you leaving the room. You need to stay in there.
Hold on just one second, okay?
Okay. Sir, I want to know, I need to know exactly where you're
you're at the house where the officers can find you when they come in.
Okay, so there's two different ways to get through.
One is by the very back door.
There's another door that looks down in the basement where I ride by that door.
And if you're going through the house,
if you go all the way down stairs, all the way into the base,
there's a bedroom down there.
And if you go all the way back and just keep following it back,
there's going to be a sliding door that is really stuck,
and we're on here.
So you're in the basement, though?
Yes.
In the basement, in the back, in the back of the basement behind the sliding glass door?
No, there's no sliding glass door.
No, you're in the basement, in the back of it?
Yes, in the back of the basement.
It's set up like a mother-in-law.
There's a kitchen, a bathroom, a big bedroom,
and if the officers first walk through the door, they'll see a desk,
and if they take a left, they will...
They'll start heading toward the back where there's a bunch of computers.
If they slide back there, it's kind of skitties, they'll get to a place with the kitchen.
How many of you are there?
There's three of us back here.
There's three of you?
Yeah.
Males?
Females?
There's two other males.
There's three of us in total.

or three more roommates upstairs um so we have there's a total six people who live in the house
one of which i know is not here at the time five of which were here i saw one of them um through the
window and he saw me and he saw me on the phone so he was sort of like running around i think um
but he was outside and he's in a big fur coat and that's the only other roommates but i ran downstairs
because there were still shots being fired after I've, like, heard stuff.
I want you to move. I just want you to stay where you're at.
Okay.
Okay, just stay on the phone.
That's okay. I'm kind of drunk, and this is really kind of freaking me out.
