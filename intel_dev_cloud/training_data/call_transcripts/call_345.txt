He should have passed a physical, too.
Okay.
Is there a defibrillator on Stene and all?
Yes, there is a defibrillator.
Okay.
Have someone grab that in case we need it later.
Now, you said he is not alert, but is he unconscious?
or is he conscious?
What do you say he's conscious or unconscious, Mike?
He's semi-conscious.
Semi-conscious?
Okay.
We're getting no movement.
Okay.
What I want you to do is I want you to get him flout on his back, nothing under his head.
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah, that's where he's at now.
Okay.
So what I want you to do, sir, is I want you to kneel next to him, look in his mouth.
Is there any food or vomit?
Look in his mouth.
Is there food or vomit?
There's nothing.
No, there isn't.
We're going to start CPR.
No, no, don't start CPR if he's breathing.
No, he says don't.
Is he breathing?
If he's breathing, we don't want to do CPR.
Is he breathing?
No.
He is not breathing.
He has stopped breathing?
Yes.
Okay.
I want you to place your hand on his forehead.
Your other hand under his neck.

Okay, I want you to put the defibrillator on the floor next to his head, on the side closest to you.
They put the defibrillator on the floor next to his head, the side closest to it.
Okay.
Okay.
Now you want to remove his shirt.
Now we have it pulled up.
Do we need to remove it or can we just pull it up?
As long as you've got his bare chest.
Okay.
We've got fluid coming out of his mouth.
We took him to the side.
Okay.
Yep.
Clean out his mouth.
I'm sorry.
What's that, sir?
Clean out his mouth.
Is there someone there that can open the AED and get it at...
Yeah, yeah, we got three people here.
Do you have paramedics there now?

Okay
Now are the pads already plugged into the machine, sir?
No
Okay, someone needs to install the pads, plug the pads in
There should be instructions as part of the machine
Okay
Someone continues CPR while the other person is
Putting the AED together
Okay
Okay.

In case of emergency, press the green
off-off button.
Okay, sir, the pads?
Is everything installed?

Hey, can somebody help me out with the pads, you guys?
And make sure someone's continuing CPR.
Yeah, we got CPR going on.
We need to get the pads and stuff.
Okay, the engine is getting really close.
What do you need out of here to use?
The pads should usually be in a flat foil or plastic package.
Flat coil or plastic package.
Can't see pads?
Yeah, if they're not plugged in, they're usually in a foil package or some sort of plastic package.
So it would be underneath the unit itself.
