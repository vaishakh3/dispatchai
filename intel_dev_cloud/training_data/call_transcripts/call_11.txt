911, do the entire medical police?
No, ma'am, I don't.
I don't have an emergency, too.
Police officers just left my house just now.
Could we get their names, please?
Just the music turned down.
He was the cutest cop I've seen it.
God, that's how long.
I just know his name.
Sorry, I know it's not an emergency, but heck.
It's going to come very often.
A good-looking man comes at your doorstep.
Did you throw him back my way?
Do you need them to come back there?
Oh, I'd like that, yeah.
Why do you need them to come back there?
Because I have an emergency.
I'll think of something.
Would you throw them back, I think of partners,
throw them back my way, would you?
Okay, and what is the reason?
My dog.
Just blame it on my dog.
Can I discuss that with them?
Thank you.
Yay.
In a way, shape, a form, an emergency.
But if you would give the officers my phone
and ask him to come back, other than I know they have terrible lots of things to do in Aloha.
Would you mind?
I'll give them a message to call you.
Thank you very much.
Bye-bye.
