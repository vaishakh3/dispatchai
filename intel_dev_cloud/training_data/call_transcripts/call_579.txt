If any cops come in this house with any guns, I will fucking shoot them.
I will kill them.
Do you understand me?
Can I get your name, sir?
Yes, my name is John Defano.
Okay, John, are you in security?
What do you mean?
Are you in the town of security?
Because I'm not sure that you're in Colorado Springs.
You may be right outside of my area.
Yes.
So you are insecurity?
Yes, I am.
Okay, I'm going to need to transfer you over to the sheriff's office.
Will you stay on the phone with me?
Yes, I will.
Okay, hang on just one second.
Let me ask you a question.
Mm-hmm.
Can you stick on the line with me at all?
Because I'm not talking to these people anymore.
Sure, John.
I'll have enough of the shit.
I'll certainly do that, okay, hang on a second.
Let's just remember.
I am armed and I will shoot.
Okay, what kind of gun do you have?
I have a 22.
Okay.
Is it a pistol?
Oh, yes, it is.
Okay.
And you have two people there?
Yes, I do.
An 18-year-old and her father.
Okay.
Okay, I want you to hang on the phone with me.
They're duct taped in the next room.
They are duct-taped and rope together.
Okay.
Let me get you over to the county, okay, and I'll hang on the phone with you, John.
All right.
And you're going to be talking.

Hi, okay, this is Jennifer.
Okay, so what exactly is going on?
I'm not talking anymore.
Okay, you can't talk?
I'm not talking anymore.
Like I said, I am armed.
John, is it okay if I tell her what's going on?
Yes, you may.
Okay. All right, County, he advised me that he has two people there that he's holding hostage.
Okay.
An 18-year-old is named Danielle and her father.
He said he has them duct tape in another room.
Okay.
That he is armed with a 22 pistol, and that if any officers do come into the residency will shoot.
Okay.
His last name is.
I just remember, I will shoot.
I'm not afraid.
I will shoot, and then I will kill myself because I don't care, okay?
Do you understand?
No, John, I do understand, okay?
John, did you spell your last name for us?
D-E-F?
Mm-hmm.
A-N-N-N-N-M.
Okay.
Okay.

Hold on second.
Shut up.
I'm still there.
Mm-hmm.

Uh, 18-year-old and her father, okay?
Okay.
And if any cops come in here, armed, I want, if any cops are coming in here, I want, if any cops are coming in here, I want their guns outside.
Do you understand?
Yeah, I'm listening.
Hang on.
I'm just pet in what you're telling me, okay, so that we're sure that we don't have anything happen, okay?
All right.

Is he injured?
The father, yes.
Is he severely injured?
He's bleeding profusely.

What can I do to help him right now?
You want to help him?
Well, I want to help you.

I want to make sure that nobody else gets hurt.
If I'm going to jail, I'm going to kill myself and them.
Okay.
I'm not going nowhere.
Okay. What's going on tonight? Why are you doing this?
I'm not talking anymore.
Okay.
That's all I said. You have the address. You have everything.
Okay. Well, will you just stand the line with me?
I'm hanging up now.
John, this is Crystal. I'm still on the phone. Will you be willing to talk to me?
I'm hanging up now.
You're not willing to stay on the phone with us?
No, I'm not.
You can't tell us anymore about why this happened tonight?
Rapping a family member is not acceptable, all right?
Oh yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Didn't I not tell you?
Mm-hmm.
You did, and I just want the county to understand what's going on.
Why don't you talk?
You all the information down.

I want help here now.
I don't have help here now in the next five minutes.
I swear to fucking God, I'll shoot them.
these people. Do you understand?
Yes, but it's not going to help the situation if you hang up.
I'm hanging up the phone. Do you understand?
I hear you. I'd rather...
I'm hanging up the phone. Do you understand?

You want somebody killed?
No, I don't.
Shut your mouth and do your job.
