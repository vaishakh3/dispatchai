Dan County 911 with Seattle for emergency.
Hi, um, I think I may have found a possibly a body in a trash bag.
Okay, where are?
And then girls are missing from Ohio.
Yeah, where are you?
And what makes you think it's possibly her?
Um, well, I can smell, I just turn around here and I was doing some paperwork,
And I could smell something, I could see like, like, you can tell through Mars.
Yeah.
Not the far as it was, like, as I knew that girl's just like, I'll just look.
You know, there's a trash bag back there.
And the only reason I just couldn't think of me would rather even want it,
so I got my, uh, double to kind of poke a dozen.
I couldn't tell what it is at first, but then there's definitely a Hooters shirt.
I could read Hooters across the shirt.
Okay.
Right.
And is there, like, definitely more than clothing in there?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I mean, at first, I mean, so big I saw maybe,
like, to a turtle maybe or something, something in there.
But when I saw that, you know, material, like shirt material,
I broke as much as I could make sure
because it's the future, so.
Okay, and the smell's really bad, right?
Yeah, yeah.
And your name is heard?
All right.
We'll get a deputy right out to you, okay?
Okay.
Okay.
Thank you.
Bye-bye.
