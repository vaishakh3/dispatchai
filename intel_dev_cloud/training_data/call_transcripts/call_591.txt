How's called you?
Mark, Navasu, I'm in security.
Okay, Marco.
We're going to send a unit
more soon as soon as possible, okay?
Okay, thank you, ma'amble.
Okay, thank you.
No one operator with the emergency.
Yes, ma'am.
I'd like to see if you can send out an officer to the Chico's Tacos?
Chico's Tacos?
Yes, sir.
Which one?
Hello.
Hello, sir?
Yes, sir.
Let me talk with the bombers.
Okay, but which chikos
I need to know, I just first.
Mottwood.
Okay.
And what's going on there?
It's because we came to eat, and a couple that's with us, they're two males.
And they're boyfriends, and they're kissing, and they're kicking us out.
They're kicking you out?
Yeah, they're saying that it's not allowed for us to do, like, well, for them to do that here,
and they want to kick us out.
And they're saying that it's a law that you can't be doing that in public.
Just purchase our food here.
Okay, so you were kissing with somebody.
No, no, no. Two friends that are with us, they were actually kissing. I mean, not like a huge thing. It was like they just gave each other a peck on the mouth. And we all had just a suit and the security guards here, we're saying that if they kept doing their nonsense here that they were going to throw us out, because it's a public place and you're not allowed to do something like that.
What is your name?
My name's Carlos.
Is that what I mean?
Uh, Diaz.
B-I-A-Z.
So I just think it's a violation of our right.
You know, okay?
Just go ahead and speak to the officer when he gets there, okay?
All right, thank you.
You're welcome.
Bye-bye.
No, an operator to Corral, what is your emergency?
Uh, sir, this has been, like, five minutes,
I'll hear of here, the Chico St.
Yes, sir.
No, no, they've been here.
No, they're here, but I just want to know
if I did what chikos, because there are Monwood.
Yes, sir.
Yes.
and they're gonna to see the unidavis,
there are the kids of the Montwell.
Okay, I...
Mark-Nabas, I'm just...
Mark, Navas, I'm just
just wanted to be aggressive.
Okay.
And there's a child and there's the family
and other people who are
doing some restaurants, right?
Yes, sir, we're going to
send them to, okay?
Okay, thanks, very much.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
My mom.
The man, the prega, so much, yes.
Hello, the Spanish.
Yes, do me.
This, it's like, five minutes, I talked with an operator of a
and I said, I'm a guarder of the Chicokewomwood.
They're some of those people here, besandons,
men, for them, for them, they're just asexual,
and I just, and I just made the attention, no more,
that they can't be doing this here, right?
And because there's family and there are people.
Uh-huh.
So, they said, you know, me's discriminating to the police,
and he goes, yeah, they're going to go to the police,
but I said, I'm going to say, I'm going to be the guard.
Uh-huh.
So then he came to other person that, like, they're expecting
and they're still in the police.
But no, they've got to the patruia.
There's about 10 minutes that I've
I've been about two times,
this is the third.
For that's the reason,
and the second, I'll say that was
because I said,
I don't me, I mean,
where it was.
Okay,
here we have the call.
This,
the police are a little occupied,
but in a few occupations
for you,
very amable,
thank you.
Okay, no.
Okay, no.
Okay.
I'm going to help you.
Uh, yes, ma'am.
I'm sorry to bother you.
I called right now about a complaint at Chico Spackles on Montwood and Treywood.
Okay, give me one second.
You said Montwood and Treywood?
Yes, ma'am.
They're going to close a little bit and we have a little issue here at the Chico Staccos with the security guard.
Okay.
And we really need them to get over here.
Okay. It looks like we do still have the call, and we'll be sending someone out as soon as possible.
Is it going to take a while because they do close in a little bit?
It's really difficult for me to say, but I can assure that they will be there as soon as possible,
especially with the weather. There's a lot of things going on tonight.
I have a question for you. Sure.
See, this is it's a bunch of guys hanging out.
It's five of us, and two of them are gay.
We walked in, we all placed our order, and one guy reached over and gave the other guy a kiss on the lip, just like a peck on the lip.
The security guard sure came and said that they started telling them, if you guys keep up with your shit, we're going to kiss you and hook out, like, cutting out of us like that.
And I said, you know what, you're not allowed to tell us what we can do or not do.
I mean, we're not doing anything crazy or anything, you know?
So, I think that's a little, like, it's like discrimination, no?
Uh-huh.
And it was, nobody's in the restaurant.
Nobody was here.
So that's why I called the food.
And the security guards got really, really crazy with us.
And we had to just order our food and, you know, we're not even enjoying it.
We're just waiting for the cops to show it.
I called my parents.
I called, one of my cousins.
the sergeant in the police department, his name's in Ritkennya.
Um, Q.
So we're a little bothered about it because they just ruined everything for us.
What is your name?
My name is Khadl.
Your last name, Karlo?
D-A-A-Z.
But I do think it's a little discrimination.
He said, the security guard said,
we don't allow girls to kiss or guys to kiss.
Um, whatever y'all do.
out of here is your business, but if you guys are doing that shit here, we're going to kick
me the fuck out.
I was like, excuse me?
So, I mean, whether people like it or not, it's a little discrimination, no?
Right.
Well, sir, we do have all the information and we're trying to get someone out there as soon
as possible.
And are they still combative towards you or?
Yeah, the security guards are.
Not the, like the staff of the, of the, of the, of the.
The security guards?
But it's just, you know, the rent-a-cost that they have.
Right.
Okay, Carlos, we do have the call, and we're going to be sending someone out as soon as possible.
If for any reason he becomes, you know, any more aggressive or combative, then go ahead and give
us a call back, okay?
Okay.
Are you going to be waiting inside or outside?
We're actually, we're going to be waiting inside.
What color shirt do you have on, Carlos?
Well, I'm in a white shirt in khaki, Japan.
My father just got here too. He's in a gray shirt and a, like, charcoal pants.
You're down there?
Yeah, I'm right here. What that?
Your dad just got it there?
Yeah, my dad's here with a seat. I call him and fall in the situation.
My mother's trying to get a hold of my cousin in the kid to get out here.
Okay, Carlos, we do have the call and we'll be sending someone out as soon as possible.
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
Bye-bye.
