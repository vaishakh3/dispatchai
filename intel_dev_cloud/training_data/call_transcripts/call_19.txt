911.
What's address the emergency?
There's an accident.
We just got there.
And we're on our way.
Where are you at?
We were on our way to somebody's hogs.
Okay, where are you at right now?
Guys, where are we at?
Two of our guys aren't moving, but there's so breathing.
Somebody just hold us.
Okay, I need to know where you're at before I can get anybody to you.
Where are we, guys?
Senator, where are we?
You're out.
Take us coming off of Staten Avenue.
We're on the hill.
You're where?
If you take a lot, going off the Staten Avenue,
on our way to work.
Are you near birth at high school?
Yeah, we're lost off of Bertha High.
Okay, and tell me the condition of everybody.
How many people are hurt?
When we go, one of our guys is running around, a stressor, I mean, Tyler isn't even moving.
They were trying to fix the pot tire and somebody else from behind.
Well, I think some of them have with flash, so.
What's that?
Several of us have with flashed as...
How many, how many, okay, stop, stop, stop.
How many people are hurt?
Um, two of them aren't moving.
There's, uh, they're not, they're breathing, but, uh, a couple of those have with glasses.
Um, there's a one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, seven people here.
Okay, so out of seven, how many are hurt?
Um, two of them are severely hurt.
They're laying on the floor.
Okay, other than two, how many other people are hurt?
I need to know how many people are hurt, whether it's minor or major.
There's two of them are on the ground.
The rest are fine.
Please hurry.
Okay, all right, they're coming.
I just have a few more questions for you, okay?
Hold on one second.
You can't get it out?
No, Ali, I'm talking to do you want.
Okay, now those people that aren't moving, I want to make sure that they continue to breathe, okay?
I want you to check on each one of those.
We just can't get up, and Tyler's completely out.
Okay, and is Tyler the one that was changing the tire?
They were both out because he took it.
They were behind the tuck, and that's what got hit.
Okay, so did they also get hit?
Yeah, I think they did.
Okay.
He tried to jump out of the way, and I think Tyler actually got hit.
Okay, all right, check on Tyler for me, then.
Let me know how he's doing.
I tell him, he's not responding or anything.
Okay.
He's not responding or anything.
Okay, I want somebody to get right by him.
I want to make sure he continues to do.
breathe. Okay, if he's still breathing, yeah, he keeps breathing, he's still breathing.
Okay, I'm going to keep you on the line with me until we get the parameters though, okay,
because I need any more directions or anything. And I want you to keep communicating with that
person as with Tyler, because I want to make sure he stays breathing, okay? Okay. Okay, okay.
Okay, take my phone. And take care of me. Okay, and tell that person,
do not move him unless he's in danger, okay?
Where exactly are you guys at from birth at high school? Are you on Spartan or no?
Hello. Let me call right back.
The caller is probably going to be better than mine because mine is very hysterical.
I'm sorry.
I want to see.
I'm afraid, Mark.
We're again.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So, this is all this is...
