Okay.
You said there was no tent?
I think it's pretty dark
Okay, would you be willing to be willing to meet with a deputy
Oh no, I don't think I'm very...
They just need to get information about what you might have seen
So that way they can find this guy
It's really important if you'd be willing to meet with a deputy
It would be really, really helpful
I had the force my substitute, you know, this had happened.
I know, and I do appreciate it.
We can get this information, you know, we do need to get this information from you, though,
so anything that you could possibly tell a deputy, just so that way you can tell them what they saw or what you saw.
They're not going to do anything about you.
They're not going to give out your information.
They're not going to disclose anything about you.

No one's going to know you've talked to a deputy.
No one...
It's going to come up as an unknown number on your phone, so no one's even going to be able to see that.
We're not going to give any of your information out.
It's just really, really important in a situation like this,
that anyone that has any information about it can give that information to the deputies.
So we're not trying to get you in trouble or anything like that
or make it look like you, you know, did something that isn't what you want to do.
It's just really important.
