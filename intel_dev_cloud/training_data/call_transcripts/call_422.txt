Yeah, hi.
I have a kind of a particular emergency here.
My cat attacked our seven-month-old child, and I kicked the button the cat in the rear, and
it has went off over the edge, and we aren't safe around the cat.
It's a very large Himalayan, and we're trapped in our bedroom.
He won't let us out of her door.
Okay.
Does the child need medical attention?
No.
No.
on his forehead, but the cat, we don't know what to do about the cat. He's going, he's trying
to attack us. He's very, very, very, very hostile. I try to get him hold of animal control.
Hang on just a second. You guys are inside your bedroom right now. Yeah, yeah. And if I, when I
leave out of the bedroom to let the police in, I'm going to have to fight this cat.
Hang on just a second. And then when you say the cat is large, how large?
22 pounds, maybe.
What's the address there? What apartment number?
Okay, and I need to hang on hold for just a moment.
I need to run something by my supervisor, but I'll be right back to it, okay?
Don't hang out.
All right.
Doesn't mean.
And you said your child does not need medical attention, right?
No, no, he's just got a couple gashes on sports.
It's a very small puncture when little punctures.
Okay, and do you think the cat is ill?
I don't know.
I think that the cat is, he's got kind of a history of violence.
he's kind of a violent cat already
he's charging us
he's at our door a bedroom door
one moment okay

I hear him hold on keep your door shut okay

to help you okay all right thank you
