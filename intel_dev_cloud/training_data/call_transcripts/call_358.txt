Stay on the line, okay?
Yep.
How old is this person?

Okay.
Are you able to get behind him or her?
Is she okay?
No.
It's okay.
Okay.
She's really turning purple.
Okay.
Do you know how to do that?
Is that her crying?
No, that's my three-year-old.
All right.
Go get Anna.
I'm sure Anna knows.
Can you have somebody stand behind her?
My son is behind her right now.
Okay, wrap his arms around her abdomen.
Right around her abdomen.
And then lift up and towards him.
Oh my God, she's about pass out.
Okay, lift up and towards him.
Up and towards her.

Keep going.
Oh my God, she's turning right now!
Okay.
My partner has the ambulance on the way.
Thank you.

Tell me what's going on right now.
Are you okay, Boggs?
Keep going up and towards her right into her abdomen.
A little bit higher than the abdomen.

You're hurting her, Ty.
I can't do it.
You keep trying.
Oh my God, I cannot watch this.
Keep going.
The ambulance is on its way.
She's crying.

But she's turning purple.
That means she's getting some hair.
That's good.

Thank God.
Excellent.
Oh my God.
They're going to still come over and they're going to check on her to make sure that she's okay.
Thank you so much.
All right.
