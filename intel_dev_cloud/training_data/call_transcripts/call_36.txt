Delvin 911, what's your emergency?
Yes, I live at 301 South 2nd Street.
Mm-hmm.
I've got a gentleman here that says there's been some gunshots fired outside.
Okay.
Did you hear them yourself, or did you?
No, I didn't.
The gentleman is right here.
He wants to talk to you.
Okay, put him on.
Hello?
Okay, you see gunshots?
Yeah, I wasn't telling my house, and my sister-in-law, her boyfriend,
come and start shooting everybody.
I'm actually jumping part of the roof.
You saw the person doing this?
Yeah.
Okay, where at?
309 second straight.
3.09.
Can you go for you, please?
What's the person's name that's shooting?
Roberto.
3.0.1.
What's his name?
I can't think of that's a freaking name right now.
Okay.
Is he still there with the gun?
I think so.
He's at 309.
I went into the roof, and I, I, like, jump out.
He's upstairs shooting?
He started shooting my wife and all the kids.
He started shooting.
I don't know.
Hey, listen, at 309 South Second Street, he's shooting your wife and kids?
You see, I still shooting my wife, and I still shooting his, I don't know about the
people, but I was another of my friend.
Okay.
My wife's friend.
Okay.
So he's at the house, well?
Yeah.
Okay, hold on for a moment.
