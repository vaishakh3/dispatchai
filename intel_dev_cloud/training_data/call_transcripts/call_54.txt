And get some people started
I'll stay on the line with you though, okay
How far offshore are you?
How far offshore are you?
Approximately a mile
A mile off shore
Or a mile from the landing?
Hi, State Patrol. I've got a boat that's capsized on Minnesota Lake about a mile south of the landing. Two people hanging on, one cannot swim.
Okay, a mile south of the landing? Yes. Okay. All right. I will paste fire name and I'll follow it for them.
Okay, you're going to stay on line or do you want me to stay on line with him?
It doesn't make any difference. Why don't you stay in line with them? Okay, and then I'll let you come back.
Yeah, I'll leave it open.
Minnesota Lake bolt caps on the way.
No paddles.
Nothing floating at all other than the boat.
What are flowing there?

Do you have his buddy?
Yeah, he's keeping him afloat.
Okay.
Hey, I want it.
Yeah, stay on the line.
We'll stay on the line with you as long as we can.
If you need to put the phone down to grab him, you do it.
Oh, they're on the lake, gosh.
Can you see any houses by you?
I mean, to help...
Just right out in the middle of the lake.
Just right out in the middle, okay.
We can see the boys and all that shit.
All right.
We're getting tired, though.
Yeah, you can hang in there for us.
Just hang in there, yep.

Where are they?
They're out of the way!
You're still here with me?
Yep, we're still here.
I'm fired department guy, too, so I'm trying to see my friends.
Okay. You still got him to blow it?
Huh?
You still got him above water?
Yeah.
I paid fire an ambulance.
There's an officer on the way out there.
I can't hear you.
We paid to fire an ambulance, and there's an officer on the way out there.
I don't go out so we can hear something.

Are we both floating yet, sir?
You're both above water?
We're both above water, but we're on the long.
Yeah.
Stay with us, keep treading the best you can.
We can't hear the ambulance.
We can't hear the fire truck.
There should be an officer getting close.
Oh, my sir.
They're coming.
Dad, shut up!
Thank you.
Sir.
You see the deputy?
No, we don't see nothing.
Okay.
There's a white captain, a lot of luck.
Yeah, I'm sure there is out in the middle.
He's probably going to have to swipe a boat from somebody.
Yeah, yeah.
Right on the county line rolls.
Who are we talking to?
My name is Keith Klamma.
Keith, okay.
And you got WOTUS.
You on a fire department where?

Oh, they're going to have to find out of the way.
What's the position?
Huh?
They're going to be coming from the landing,
so they're going to have to fight the lake just like you are.
We're just in further south.
Further south?
Our position is further south.
We're almost in line with the buoy.
I see a white truck or something out there.
Okay.
It's head and you're killing.
Okay.

You're on Swift getting over.
Where are they?
The car is, buddy.
Oh, it's the car.
They're almost here.
Okay.
The red gas tank is approaching we
10 feet away from us now.
Is that gas tank, that gas tank's floating if you can grab it?
It's floating ahead of us.
Oh, floating ahead?
What?
It's floating ahead of you?
Yeah.
Boy, if you could grab that too, it would help.
We don't see the boat or anything yet.
Is the boat in the water?
I don't know, Keith.
The boat is not in the water yet.
It's on his way.
They're just put in the water right now.
No, no, they're coming.
Buddy, they're coming.
Easy.
Keep them calm, Keith.
You're doing a great job.
Easy, oh, they're coming.
They're coming.

Is that a light out there on the edge?
Is that a squad car?
You can see the squad light?
Yeah.
Where are they from you?
Where are the lights had, Keith, from you?
We're directly in line with it.
You're directly, you're floating right towards it?
No, we're floating south, but we're directly in line.
Okay, there's a red, it looks like a rescue truck coming up towards it.
Okay, keep hanging in there.
Bearville County, you got a...
And there's a rescue truck.
Yeah, I'm passing it on.
All right.
Okay, the refugee truck still coming.

Okay, they got a nice warm spot for you when they bring you on.
Strange irony, the fireman being rescued from the fireman.
Hey, that's not uncommon, Keith. That's not uncommon at all.
Huh?
Huh?
Are they?
They see us in the binoculars.
I wish I had my one off.
Oh, I hear something.
You should have something?
I see three vehicles on the edge of the tree lines.

I don't know what happened, over there.
Are those vehicles on the road still got them in sight?
Yeah, they don't.
Oh, no water.
I see a red vehicle at something time, and, ah.
Okay, it's going on, no, I'm still gone.
Turbo Coney, I've got to take a call, but I'll come back.
