We're at 9-1-1 with the address of the emergency.
I think?
I think we're on 75.
I-75?
Yes.
Okay.
Do you know what mile marker?
No, I can't see anything.
It's so dense.
The fog is so dense and we just hit a guard wheel and I think there was another accident behind us because I heard it.
Are you northbound or south down?
We are going southbound on 75.
Okay, we're going to get you some help out there.
What's the fun of you're calling some area?
You could first?
Oh my gosh.
It's so dark here.
Okay.
And let me see.
Just one second.
Okay, hold on.
Okay.
Okay, what is the city that you're nearest?
Have you seen any signs for a city recently?
Um, are we near Gainesville?
We just passed Gainesville.
We just passed Gainesville, University.
Okay, hold on just one second while I get this in, okay?
Okay, it's very dangerous, so please be careful.
No, we are, just one second.
There's lots of smoke and fog.
There's a lot of fog.
Okay, um, are you out of the roadway?
We are out as far as we possibly can.
Okay, that's good.
Um, are there any injuries in your vehicle?
No, no, thank God.
Okay.
No, but I think I heard another crash back there.
Okay, you heard another crash?
I thought I did, but I'm not sure.
Okay.
What's the color-making model of your vehicle?
When you stay behind the car so we don't get hit to see you?
Okay.
Did you hit, you just hit the guardrail or was there another vehicle involved?
No, we hit the guardrail.
Okay, and you said you are out of the road as much as you can be?
Are you blocking in the lanes of traffic?
No.
Okay, just one back in.
Oh, he stopped.
Okay, somebody stopped with you.
That's good.
Just stay inside your vehicle until law enforcement gets out there, though.
Do you smell any, besides the smoke outside?
Do you smell any leaks?
I'm not smoke.
No.
Okay.
It's just the thing, the smoke from the, something burning.
Okay.
So no hazards, no leaking fluid or hazmat?
No, there's somebody else here that stops with us, so.
Okay.
Hold on just one second.
We are getting help out there to you.
Okay.
Oh, hang on a second.
Okay.
Can you talk to my friend?
Okay.
Hello.
Hello, ma'am.
Yes.
Hi, this is also with the electric Kenny Sheriff's Office.
We do have help coming out there to you now.
I'm showing you near Mile Marker 390, I'm sorry, 379, could that be where you are?
Yeah, we pass, you know, the exit to go to Gainesville, right?
And then the next one we passed another exit, and then we're about that side.
Okay, and you said you were southbound, correct?
Yes, ma'am.
Okay, I just wanted to double check.
Ma'am, what is your name?
Okay, and so there are no injuries whatsoever inside your view?
No, there's no injuries.
It's definitely the real need of tow truck, I presume.
Yeah, no, that's fine.
We can sort that out later.
Let me see.
I'm going to stay on the line with you until the unit find you just because it is very hazy,
so I want to make sure they do find.
It's really bad out here, yeah.
People are just stopping, yeah.
Okay, if you're going south-down, were you on the left side or the right side of the road?
I pull the car all the way over to the right side onto the grass.
Hold on just one second.
You said the right side?
Yes.
have to let you go. We have a lot of limes ringing right now, but we do have help going out there, too.
And this is shit, another accident. Okay. Oh, my gosh. What just happened? Tell me, what happened.
Another accident, another accident going northbound. Okay. Yeah. Oh, my goodness. And that was a truck.
Okay, and what kind of truck, like, a semi or pickup? We can't see. We cannot see. It's, like,
impossible to see. The haze is, um, or the smoke is, like, very thick. You can probably see only your hand in front. I do hear. I do hear a
an ambulance or a police officer coming down the room.
Okay, just one second.
Okay.
Hold on just one second.
Stand the line, don't hang up.
No problem.
No problem.
Wow.
Okay, and you said you see a truck.
No one hit you, somebody hit on the other side.
Okay, okay, so that was, was that a semi that hit you or?
Are you serious?
Yes.
Where are you heading?
There's another one over here.
Okay.
Oh, there?
Yes.
Yes, they come across there.
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my God, what is going on?
Okay, we are getting help out there, okay?
Oh, my goodness.
How many vehicles have been involved that you've seen so far?
We cannot see, ma'am.
We cannot see.
This is the third one now already.
All right, I want you to, if you're able to, turn on your emergency flasher,
get out of your vehicle and step as far away from traffic as you know.
We are.
We are, ma'am.
Oh, we are.
We are as far away as you can see.
Okay, you're doing really good.
So you said you saw it.
Okay.
It's okay. Take a deep breath for me, okay? You saw two years' accidents, one northbound? Was the other one southbound?
No, the other one was also northbound. Okay. Leave your light on and your blinkers. Yeah, because another car just pulled up.
Okay. So we're just letting them know to do the same. Okay, good. Just tell them to get their vehicles out of the roadway, turn on the headlights and flashers, and get out of the road. Okay, hold on. She said to put on, take your car, pull it all the way over to the road as far as you can.
Okay, ma'am.
Yeah.
I put your headlights on and your flashes.
Okay, as far as you're able to tell, is everybody able to get out of the vehicle?
Oh, yes, ma'am.
Okay.
I'm going to ask you a couple of medical questions.
Sure.
Actually, a lot of these won't apply.
Just give me your best answer.
Just tell me as best if you can.
If you don't know, that's fine.
Okay, ma'am, how many people would you guess are injured?
Uh-oh, uh-oh.
Another one.
Okay.
Okay, that's four vehicle.
vehicles involved? Yeah. Four vehicles coming, one coming south now. About how many people, I'm sorry,
are you, are you with the patients right now? No, ma'am. We are too far away. There's no way we can
see it. Okay, and you, how many people are hurt, you know? Okay, hold on. We're hearing another
one. He's stopped in time. Oh, God. Um, I would say, it sounds like trucks, so it would be
three trucks, would be three drivers. Okay.
I don't know the one coming south down.
I did hear the police coming and then I can't hear anymore.
Okay, we are getting help out there.
I'm here.
Do you know if there are chemicals or other hazards involved?
Couldn't tell you.
Okay.
Oh my gosh.
Yeah, another one.
Oh my goodness, this is bad.
You know what it is because they can't see?
Yeah, that's what it is.
Is anyone pinned or trapped in their vehicles?
or is everyone seeming to be able to get them, ma'am, ma'am, this is the 10th one now.
Okay, we just have five in a row.
Okay, is anyone pinned?
Oh, we can't tell.
Okay, was anyone thrown from their vehicles?
We can't tell.
Okay.
Okay, hold on with you're doing such a good job.
You're doing such a good job.
Does everyone appear to be completely awake as far as you can tell, just as what you've seen?
Yes, we all are.
We all are.
Are there any...
Tell that lady to get away from her car and come over the side.
Yeah, tell everybody to get out of traffic as long as it's safe for you to do so.
I need you to stay safe, okay?
Somebody else is coming.
Another one.
This is going to be a 14-car pile up, 15 so far.
Okay, you see 15 vehicles now?
Yes, yeah.
Okay.
Are there any obvious injuries?
Nothing that we know.
Okay.
Is there any serious bleeding that you can see?
Yeah, but you know what?
What if, I don't know where I'm going.
You all know where you're going?
Oh, my gosh.
How many vehicles?
Yes, ma'am.
And was that another one?
Yes, ma'am.
Okay, how many vehicles now?
16.
Okay.
Do you see any fire?
Do you see anything like that?
No fire.
We can't see.
Okay.
You can hardly even see your hazards.
Okay.
Here comes another one.
Oh, my God.
He's coming too fast.
She's coming too fast.
Here comes another one.
Oh, yep.
See, there it goes.
Oh, shit, that one is a bad one.
Okay, all right.
Let me out here.
Okay, keep your, you're doing good.
Just keep yourself out of traffic, okay?
Try to direct people out of the road if you can,
but I want you to keep yourself safe.
That's the most important thing, okay?
Doing such a good job.
Just stay with me, okay?
I know this is very traumatic.
I need you to keep home for me.
Okay, ma'am, I'm sending the paramedics and the police
to help you now.
Please stay on the line.
Oh, wow.
They should already be there.
We're sending lots more.
So we're sending lots and lots of payments.
Okay, no problem.
Sit on the line.
I'll tell you exactly what to do next, okay?
No problem.
I don't want you to try to split any injuries.
Do not move anybody unless they're in danger.
Okay, for everybody's safety, tell any bystanders to stand well-clear of approaching traffic.
If it's safe to do so, just keep your flashing hazard lights on, okay?
That's right.
We are.
Okay.
If there's anybody else getting out of their vehicles, just reassure them that help is on the way,
and don't let them have anything to be able to.
Another one?
Yes, very good, very good.
Just let people know they're on their way.
Okay, don't offer anybody anything to eat or drink.
It might make them sick or cause problems for the doctor, okay?
Yes.
As people get out of the road, just let them rest in the most comfortable position
and wait for help to arrive if they're injured.
Yes.
Okay, we're anticipating a lot of injuries.
Just let them rest in the most comfortable position and just keep home for me, okay?
All right, don't move people around unless it's absolutely necessary.
just tell them to be still and wait for help to arrive out of the roadway, okay?
Yes, ma'am.
All right, you are doing amazing.
Do you see any semis or anything like that?
Yes, ma'am.
There has to be all semis.
I'm hearing people crying.
On the other side, that is northbound.
Okay.
Please slow down.
Please slow down.
Please slow down.
They're putting on their lights at least.
Thank God.
Okay.
They're slowing down, good.
Hold up.
Hold on. Hold on for one second. I'm just going to pass you to one of my friends.
Okay, that's fine. You're doing a really good job. Just stay on the line with me, okay?
Okay.
Okay, what's going on? What do you see? Just keep me uploaded, okay?
What do you see?
It's like, oh, my God.
Okay, you're safe. You're safe right now, okay? We are getting help to you.
They're already there. We're just sending more and more help to take care of all these people, okay?
Yes.
Okay. Do you see?
Those semives that are rolled over, are they all boxes or do they look like pinks or anything like that?
No, I can't really tell. We can't see anything. We cannot see anything, ma'am.
Sorry, sorry, we are at the grass.
Okay, that's good. I want you to stay out of the road, no matter what I ask you, I never want you to go into the road, okay?
We're not in the road.
Okay, good.
You're doing a really good job. Just take a couple of breath, okay?
Do you see any patience? Is there any patient?
Is somebody injured that you can see?
There's a lot of people laying down on the floor looking like.
Okay.
You see a lot of people?
Are they lying down?
Yes.
Her phone is going to die.
Oh, gosh.
How old is the woman that looks hurt?
It's on the room.
Yeah, hello?
Hello?
Yeah.
Telling me about something,
something about somebody who looks like they're going to die.
Is that right?
Um, yeah, because there's some people across the street crying.
Okay.
Okay.
I don't want you to cross the street, but can you say,
No, I'm not.
Okay, good.
Can you see anything or just hear them crying?
Well, now there's people putting on their lights, so we had somebody walking with a flashlight.
Okay.
All right.
Ma'am, can I ask you to hold on just one second and stay on the line and hang up, okay?
Okay.
Okay, hold on just one second.
Can you want me to give you my other number?
Yes.
The first one is going to die?
Yeah, what's the other number?
Give me just one second, okay?
I just need to put these lines on hold.
