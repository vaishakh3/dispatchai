Westchester, 911.
Hey, this is James on a pharmacist server with the Walgreens on Towersville Road and Cincinnati
8th Road, and we just got robbed.
Okay, what they look like?
We'll have it all on video camera.
Gentleman about 6'2, short hair, white glasses, in gray sweatpants, I think was a brown shirt.
What kind of shirt, brown shirt?
I think, yeah.
Sweat pants?
He's still in the store.
He's still in the store?
Yeah.
Like, he just cleared out all of myoxicotin morphine.
How long ago?
Just now.
And he's still inside?
I'm thinking he's going to still be in the store.
He shouldn't be out by now.
Did he have a gun or anything?
Gun, didn't really know.
It might have not been real, but he jumped over the counter and I wasn't going to argue.
Okay, why do you think he's still in the store?
Because he just left the, he just jumped back over the counter.
Okay.
Like now.
