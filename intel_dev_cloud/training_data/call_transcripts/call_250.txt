Get an alarm so they're not set it off.
We're going to work for cutting off now.
All units are not essential to this scene.
Can't 8 the area for a vehicle.
They're moving large property, TVs, etc.
10 a8 for vehicles is just an area.
Especially to the rear, whatever's behind here.
358, you're advising.
Well-enhanpled off Evans.
Okay, we're looking for a path right now.
We don't see one, but we're trying to figure out they came from here or not.
301 to all units.
When I came up to the house, there was a black Chevrolet avalanche
on the road that cuts in front of the house and goes back.
I don't know what the name of the road is.
But you may be able to look out for that vehicle.
Careful.
319, Cremel.
Go ahead.
You send an EMS for the victim shaken up.
You have a 35-year-old white female.
You're requesting two EMS trucks.
I think one's going to be for the suspect, reference the dog butt and the element can be for our victim.
Therefore.
