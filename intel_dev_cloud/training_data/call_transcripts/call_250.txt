Trying to take your grill?
Yes, ma'am.
I need to get in here, put some clothes.
I'm terrified.
Do you know how he got up there?

Is that in the back or the front of the house?
I'm in the back.
Do you have a one-floor house or is it two-story or?
It sounds like he's starting to run.
It's two stories.
And you're downstairs or upstairs?
I'm down.

Gonna be Cedarhurst Road and Bent Creek Drive.
Can you still hear him moving around in the house?
Is he downstairs or up stairs?
Are you in there by yourself?
Yeah.

He's trying to get the door in him.
Help me.

We are there. They're going to kill me.
Is it just one person in there?
Yeah. Help me.
We've got them on the way. They're coming as fast as they can.
Just stay on the line with me, okay?
And like I said, I understand if you want to be quiet,
but if you see him, if he does anything, do something or say something
so I'll know what's going on, okay?
Do you think you might know who it is?
No.
Do you live at residence by yourself?
Yes.

Do you still hear him in there?
Yeah.
Is he breaking things?
Yeah.
Is he still on?

Still on the phone.
Suspects still inside, breaking things.
Still on the first floor in the living room.

We can hear the mail's voice in the background.
She does not know who the suspect is.
We have about eight or ten officers outside, ma'am, they're going to be.
Any mayors?
See, if you know the mayor, let's go around me,
I don't have the screen up.
And I don't have a light on this car.
3613. 3613.
It's going to be right along here. I'll see. Let's get out right here on foot.
Okay, Heather, if you're on for a second, I'm coming on that, Martin.

Do you hear anything else, huh?
Yeah.
He's still in the living room, though, right?
Bad run.
He's in the bedroom just in the back of the house?
Man, we got officers all outside right now, so just hold tight.
Are there any light sound that you know of?
Yeah.
Be advised the suspects now in the back bedroom.
I'll let her know we're out on foot.
The officers are going to be on foot around your house, okay?
So if you hear anything that may be them, but continue to let
Let me know if you hear him inside doing anything.
You can still hear him, right?
Right.
You get right or left coming off the landmark?
You go left off landmark.
We're about two houses down where our view is off.
Take a left, Bobby.
Take a left.
And you see our cars.
Come on that here.
Richard, take that opposite corner.
I got this.
It's got a really big sense behind it, but we need somebody wherever that is behind it.
Back there in case he climbed it.
It's 3.7.23.
Off of Evans. Down a little ways.
It's going to be Willingham as off of Evans right past Dunhagen, the apartment, as where it backs up to it directly to it.

Alright where is our victim
Where is she in the house
She's still locked in the bathroom
Alright
Does she know where he's at now?
Still here, ma'am?
Yeah.
Is that going to be in the front of the back of house?
Sounds like the suspect is going upstairs.
Is he upstairs?
Hello, you still there?
Okay.
1-07 is in the area.
I would have got light phone, PD?
Unless she turned on or did motion?
Have you got any motion light phone in your house?
Do you have any motion lights at your house?
Are they inside or outside?
Outside, you don't have no motion lights on outside.
I put it outside.
374-3-58 are on well-in-end.
Off having seven.
I do have entry here.
Keep an eye on the front, folks.
See you let her know we're about to come over the dolls.
3835, my hair too.
3.5-8 to the unit behind the seal by the railroad tracks.
This one that's the greenlee unit.
Yeah, it is. It's me.
Do you have an attic space or anything like that on the second floor?
Carle space.
Is that noise out here coming from the bathroom?
Oh, stairs.
So he's above you upstairs?
Yeah.
374-358 on the railroad track between well and him and the house.
You have to go in here.
Going out the front, folks, he's going out the front.
There's two of them.
They just come in.
What did you say, ma'am?
He's running downstairs.
Now running downstairs.
They're coming inside with a dog, okay?
Okay.
I'm in the bathroom, locked in my bedroom.
Okay.
Oh, my God, this is me?
It's okay, just stay on the line with me.
Oh, my God.
What's your name?
Dean, I'm killing it's an emergency.
I sure will, okay?
Just stay on the line.
Is that your alarm, ma'am?
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.
I don't know.
Do a lot?
I am.
Okay, just stay there.
I'm with you on the phone.
The officer should have them.
Just stay on the line with me.
Can you call one person for me?
Yes, ma'am.
My other dispatcher is calling your parents' way.
My best friend is a hospital police officer.
Your dad is on the way to you, okay?
The officer is going to be coming to the bathroom to make contact with you, okay?
Can I open the door?
Wait just a second.
Is it okay?
You got the police officer?
You can come outside now, ma'am, okay.
You can come outside now, ma'am, okay?
Ma'am, you can come outside now, make contact with the officer.
Okay, thank you, sir, my daughter, two, and I can I hang up?
Three of seven.
Three of seven.
Two in company, in a.m., that's this location.
Okay, sir.
Okay, I'm like.
307, 104.
319.
Do you have contact with the victims?
Be upon?
Victims still in the bathroom.
Greenway units knocking on the bathroom door, confirm.
104, we're all inside.
Ovisors, come on out.
45, have contact the victim from.
345.
Get an alarm so they're not set it off.
We're going to work for cutting off now.
All units are not essential to this scene.
Can't 8 the area for a vehicle.
They're moving large property, TVs, etc.
10 a8 for vehicles is just an area.
Especially to the rear, whatever's behind here.
358, you're advising.
Well-enhanpled off Evans.
Okay, we're looking for a path right now.
We don't see one, but we're trying to figure out they came from here or not.
301 to all units.
When I came up to the house, there was a black Chevrolet avalanche
on the road that cuts in front of the house and goes back.
I don't know what the name of the road is.
But you may be able to look out for that vehicle.
Careful.
319, Cremel.
Go ahead.
You send an EMS for the victim shaken up.
You have a 35-year-old white female.
You're requesting two EMS trucks.
I think one's going to be for the suspect, reference the dog butt and the element can be for our victim.
Therefore.
