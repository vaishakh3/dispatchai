I just heard the window break.
Hold on.
What's your address?

I'm not sure.
Okay.
Do you think someone's trying to come in right now?
Yeah.
What are you hearing?
Well, they kept on ringing the doorbell.
What's your phone number?
Give me one second.
Let me look up your address.
cross street.
I'm the only one in the house.
Okay, where are you at right now?
I'm at.
Where in the house are you?
I'm in my parents' bedroom.
Okay.
Stay on the line, don't hang up.
Okay.
You said someone not bringing the doorbell?
They kept on ringing the doorbell, and I tried going, I've been looking out the window for cars,
but there's no cars outside.
And then I heard them banging on the window, and then all of a sudden I heard glass shatter.
So you heard someone banging on the window and glass shattering?
Yeah.
You take it possible 459 now
Stay on the line, okay?
All right.
Don't hang up.
No.
What are you hearing now?
I think someone's in the house.
Where do you think they're at?
Towards the other side of the house, like where my bedroom, my sister's bedroom is at.
Okay.
How many people do you hear?
I think it's just one, but I don't hear them talking.
Informant is hearing one person in the loke.
What else can you hear?
I don't know.
I can't hear anything anymore.
Okay.
Where are you at in the bedroom?
I'm over here towards the front of the house next to the window.
Is there a closet you can go into?
There is, but there's too many stuff in it.
There's what?
There's too many stuff in it.
They'll probably hear me.
Okay.
Where are you out in your mom's room?
In the corner.
If you go through the house, you see that there's a window, and I'm right there.
Are you calling me from a cell phone or a landline?
I'm calling from a phone from the house.
Okay, that's...
Yes.
Okay.
Can you hear anything else?
Not much.
Can you hear if doors opening?
Can you hear...
I'm not sure.
Okay.
What window broke?
Where did you hear the shattering from?
My sister's window.
It's on the other side of the house.
If the deputies were coming to the front, how would they explain to me how they would be able to see the broken window,
so they would know where he possibly came in through.
All right, from the door.
The front door?
No.
If you're at the door to your left all the way up on the far side, you'll see this window.
Yeah, and that's it.
Okay.
You haven't heard any more doors open or shut?
No.
Okay, what do you wear your...
I'm wearing blue jeans and a white t-shirt and...
A necklace.
A white t-shirt on what?
A necklace.
Okay, white t-shirt and what color pants?
Blue.
Jeans or?
Skinny.
Yeah, jeans.
Blue-skin jeans?
Yeah.
Okay.
How can the deputies get into the house?
My parents, since they're not here, they always said that not to let anybody in, but I try to
unlock the door.
Okay.
Are you hearing anything new?
No.
No?
Okay.
How old are you?
I'm only 15.
Okay.
He's not hearing anything right now.
He's not hearing any door shutting or cabinets open.
Okay. The deputies are on their way, okay?
All right.
How many times did you ring the doorbell?
A few times over, let's say, three minutes, like over and over.
And when you went to the door, what happened?
I didn't, or my mom said not to open the door for anybody.
Did you look out?
Yeah, or I tried to, but there's,
There is not a P-Phole or a window to look through?
No. There's nothing to look through.
Okay.
So you feel there right?
A-n-master. All right.
All right.
