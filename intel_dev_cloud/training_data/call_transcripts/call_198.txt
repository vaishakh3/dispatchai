They kept on ringing the doorbell, and I tried going, I've been looking out the window for cars,
but there's no cars outside.
And then I heard them banging on the window, and then all of a sudden I heard glass shatter.
So you heard someone banging on the window and glass shattering?

My sister's window.
It's on the other side of the house.
If the deputies were coming to the front, how would they explain to me how they would be able to see the broken window,
so they would know where he possibly came in through.
