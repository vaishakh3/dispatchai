Hello?
Okay.
I need you to calm down.
I need you to tell me.
What did you see?
I was in the shower and the lights cut out of my house.
And this man came in with a hood on.
And he had a knife and his head.
and he was covered his mouth with his glow or his hand or something.
What do you tell?
To be quiet, he had an accent, and he was dark-skinned.
Okay.
He told me to get out of the tub, and he tried to force him get in the bed,
and I told him I had a child, and then I had money, and then I'd give him money, please, me.
Okay, okay, listen.
And then I took my 22, and I shot him as much as I could, but he was just walking,
and he went outside the bag, sliding on the door, and I locked the door, and I locked the door,
ran to my neighbor's house.
I don't know where he is, and I couldn't.
He might have taken my other gun.
I have a purse of three-thundered, and it's 38, and he might have taken those.
Okay, okay.
But where is your child?
I don't have one.
I lied.
Okay, you lied to him.
Okay, so is there anyone else in your house?
No, just a cat.
Okay.
What color shirt did he have on?
It was navy blue, and you're navy blue.
It looked like, I don't even remember the pants, but he had a navy blue hoodie.
I know my bag of hurts.
Okay.
Okay, I need you to calm down, okay?
He looked at me, well, he looked at me, he had an accent, he was dark as he, he just said,
he said, just be quiet, just be quiet.
Oh, God, I fell in the tub and I brought the curtain down on me.
I tried to hit up.
Okay, what's your address?
2844-East, Mount.
Tabor circle and it's off a Buford Highway, oh, Northwarkley-like area.
Okay, all right. I already have officers on the way, okay?
I shot him. I shot him with the 22, but he just kept running, and I had another gun, but I
couldn't. I think he took it. Okay. Where are the guns now? Are they... The two guns,
the guns, I don't know what I do with the 22 who was empty. The two guns are in my nightstand next to
my bed on the left-hand side.
Okay.
And I have a gun permit.
Okay.
So you put the guns away after you shot him?
No.
I just took the one I could grab and I shot and I ran after him.
Okay.
What did you do with the gun that you shot him with?
I don't know.
I think I put it on the floor outside of the sliding glass door, inside the sliding glass door.
And I locked the door and I ran out the front door.
Oh.
Okay.
To my neighbors out, please help me.
Okay, okay.
Ma'am, we have officers over your house.
But you need to stay inside your, inside your neighbor's house right now, okay, until the officers come to you.
I'm over there now.
Please tell them I have a cat, not to let the cat out.
Okay.
I want to talk to my neighbor.
Hello?
Okay.
I can't go back there.
Okay.
Calm down, okay?
I hurt my back.
Oh my God, he was going to rape me and kill me.
I got him.
You got him.
I got him.
But only with a 22, he was still walking.
I should have gotten him with the other one.
I couldn't find it.
He was going to kill me.
He had a knife, and he turned the lights off.
I can't go back here.
It was waiting for me to let my cat outside.
I put him on the back porch.
He just watched my house.
Oh.
Okay, we, call now because we have officers over there, okay?
Yes.
Did he find him?
I don't know.
Oh, he was on my back deck.
No.
They haven't found him.
Oh, God.
Thank you.
Okay, ma'am.
Ma'am, the officer wants you to step outside because they're outside waiting on you, okay?
Oh, my bag is so bad.
Okay.
They want to see me.
Are you sure it's okay?
Yes, ma'am.
It's okay.
They're outside waiting for you.
I don't know if he stole my purse who is right near the front door.
Okay.
What?
We'll do or so go through your house with you to see if he took anything, okay?
I can't stay there.
Okay.
Can you step outside and talk to them, okay?
I'm going, but I hurt.
Where are they?
They're on over there.
They don't have my house.
Where?
Where are they?
Where are they?
Oh, my back hurt.
Can you give me a chair?
Yes, let me get your chair.
Are you with the officers?
They're going to be out.
I can't, my bag hurt so bad.
My head, thank you.
Which way do they got?
They run my back deck.
I fell down. I shot him with a 22, and I don't know if he took my purse and my other guns.
You might have a 380 person, it's under, and a 38 special.
I'm afraid he's going to hurt me.
I'm afraid to sit down here on my foot.
I hear my foot.
