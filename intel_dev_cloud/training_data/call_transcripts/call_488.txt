Okay, what am I going to do? Listen to me.
Listen to me, okay? Go ahead. Is she flat? Is she laying flat?
Yes, yes.
Can you try to get some breaths down into her mouth?
Cover her nose completely and cover her whole mouth with your mouth and try to blow some breaths into her.
Is anything going in?

No, no.
Her eyes are just like she's not even here, man.
Okay.

Then she had one a couple days ago, but it was real short, and I didn't think nothing of it.
She hit her head.
