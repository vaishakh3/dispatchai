I'm not being calm. Believe me, man. I'm just like slapping her and everything.
I'm stuck the shit out of her trying to wake her up.
Okay, what am I going to do? Listen to me.
Listen to me, okay? Go ahead. Is she flat? Is she laying flat?
Yes, yes.
Can you try to get some breaths down into her mouth?
Cover her nose completely and cover her whole mouth with your mouth and try to blow some breaths into her.
Is anything going in?
Yeah, and it's going right back down, ma'am.
Her eyes are rolling into the back of her head.
Can you feel a pulse on her anywhere?
Oh my God, I can feel her heart beating.

Yes.
Okay, that's good.
That's good.

Yeah, the door open.
Oh, my God.

Are you feeling any breath coming out of her at all?
She just took a deep breath in.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Okay, good.
That's good.
Is she responding to you at all?
No, no.
Her eyes are just like she's not even here, man.
Okay.
Has she not seizures before?
Then she had one a couple days ago, but it was real short, and I didn't think nothing of it.
She hit her head.
Okay.
