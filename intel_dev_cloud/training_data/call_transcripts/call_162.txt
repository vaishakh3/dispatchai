I don't know how much the location of your emergency.
I just got back from work from Target.
I'm at 3.38 times a dump drive.
And I find my fiance.
On the floor in the kitchen, there's blood everywhere.
Okay, okay.
Listen to me.
You see on the phone.
You said there's blood everywhere?
Is she conscious?
No, I'm not pleased it.
Is it, okay?
Okay, I need to take a deep breath, okay?
Is she conscious right now?
No.
She's cold.
I don't understand what she?
Oh, my God.
Listen to me, listen to me.
You need to calm down, okay?
We're going to get through this.
Okay, how old is she?
She just turned 59 years old.
Okay.
All right.
And you said she's not awake?
I don't want to touch anything, but there's blood.
Okay.
Can you take that?
If you awake?
I don't know.
I can't.
When I got here, the front door was unlocked.
I understand that.
I need you to answer this right now.
Is she awake?
No, she's not breathing.
She's not breathing either?
No.
Okay.
All right.
Oh, my God.
Listen to me.
And you said the door was open?
No, it was unlocked.
It's unusual for it to be unlocked.
Okay, you said it's unlocked.
Have you been to the whole house yet?
No, ma'am.
Okay, I want you to leave the house.
Are you sure she's not breathing, though?
She's not breathing.
Please, God, get somebody here.
Okay, I have them coming, okay?
But if you've not been to that whole house, I need you to,
I want you to go back outside and go to your car.
Do you understand?
Yeah.
Yes.
What do you mean that she's bleeding?
What do you mean that she's...
There's just...
When I came in here, I walked into the kitchen where I put my keys.
I'm right there.
There she was.
And I fell over and she's cold.
Okay.
But there's...
I don't...
Listen to me.
Do you think she's beyond any?
help?
Yes.
You think she is?
Please get an ambulance.
Okay, I have them coming, okay?
But I'm worried about your safety right now.
You said the front door was unlocked?
Yeah, the front door was unlocked as unusual.
All right.
Okay, give me second.
When I left at 9.30, well, I left at about a quarter to 9.
to get something to eat before I went to work at Target.
And you found her on the floor where at?
She's right where...
Well, she's right there in the kitchen and close to the dining area.
My God, it would have done something like this.
Okay.
And you said that you left the house at 9?
It was about quarter to the nine.
I left to get something to eat and then go to Target.
Okay.
What was the last time you spoke to her?
Right at that time.
We said by to each other, and she gave me a kiss, and I got in my vehicle and drove off.
Okay.
She's the love of my wife.
I do have them coming out there.
I have EMS and the fire department coming out there.
She had both outside lights on, and that's unusual for it.
I don't know what in the world.
Okay.
Okay.
I have them come out there to you.
Okay.
There had both the lights on you, sir, and they don't usually do that?
Yeah, I cut the lights off when I went through the door, I noticed it was unlocked, but, you know, I thought maybe she had gone to sleep and forgot about it.
Okay.
And so I cut the outside lights off, and I went into the kitchen, and I saw her there.
Okay.
Okay. Are you outside right now?
Yes, I'm in the driveway.
Okay.
Please tell them to hurry.
I don't know if they can do anything for, just cold as ice.
Okay.
They are on the way.
I got a third apartment law enforcement in EMS.
I'm not going to get off the phone with you, okay?
Staying on the phone with me.
Okay.
Okay.
Oh, it did this, so she's just...
Okay.
All right.
Okay.
All right.
Did you touch her at all?
Anything like that?
Yeah, I touched with the back of my hand.
Just feel of her and I, she's cold.
Okay.
Do you think you're safe where you're at right now?
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm fine.
I mean, I don't know if she fell, but there's blood.
There's a towel around her ankles and everything, and there's blood there's blood there's blood
where at her head.
And I know she was going to stay up until 12 because she always rings her grandmother's bell.
at 1201 for the 4th of July.
So I know she would have stayed up till then.
Okay.
They're coming.
Okay.
All right, go ahead and see out of thought through until they get there, though, okay?
The MS team's here.
All right.
