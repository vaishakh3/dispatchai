What's your name?
Susan Brandon.
Okay, Susan, tell me exactly what happened.
No, it's my ex-husband is sitting outside, and I think he just called 911,
and he's got a pellet gun, and I think he's saying...
Did you already call us?
My ex-husband is calling you right now, and he's called you.
I just wanted to let you know that he doesn't have a real thing.
that he's calling to say that somebody has a gun outside.
He's drunk, and I think he wants to be taken away.
I mean...
What's your husband's name?
Ex-husband, Ronald Brandon.
He's been staying with me, and he's drunk, and...
And he said that someone else had a gun?
Yes, and it's him.
I think, yeah, I don't know whether he's kind of...
Okay, does he have a gun?
No, he has a pellet gun.
Is it loaded?
No.
There's no...
I don't think there's any pellets in it.
I'm sure.
It's been forever that he's had it.
Okay.
Why did your husband call us?
I think he called you because he wants to end his drunkenness.
You know what I mean?
Oh, guys, here the silence is coming.
Jesus craminy.
It's not a real gun.
I think he wants to be taken away.
Okay. So Susan, you did not call us earlier, though, right?
No, I did not call. Okay. What race is your husband? What was? What race is he?
He's white. Okay. And describe him.
He's got a beard. He's 49, 48 years old. He's got a striped shirt on in jeans, shorts.
Stripe shirt and shorts. So he's the whole, what's black? What's black?
What's going on?
Oh, my God.
What's going on, Susan?
Tell me what's going on, Susan.
They shot you.
They shot your husband?
Oh, God.
I think we have shots fired on Camden.
Okay, okay, stay calm.
Okay, is your husband shot?
You're shot.
Okay, stay on the phone with me, okay?
Stay in the house.
Stay in the house.
Oh, God.
Stay in the house.
Yes.
I'm on with the white.
Listen, ma'am, there's a poison.
Listen, ma'am, we have help on the way, okay?
I want you to stay inside the house, Susan.
Oh, God, thank you, Kyle, Brown.
He's shot.
There's nobody else around.
Okay, regardless of what kind of gun he had,
he must have rambished it at the officer, okay?
I'm sure he did that's what I was calling to tell you.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, Jesus.
Okay, can you see your husband now?
He's been there with blood on.
From his head?
From his head?
Yes, I think it's from his head.
Oh, God.
Susan, who's yelling?
Susan, who's yelling?
You're going?
You're all female.
It's just me.
Susan, listen to me.
Who is yelling?
Well, the officer is yelling.
I'm on with 911, okay?
Are the officers asking me to come out?
He's just telling me to move.
Do not move.
You know, it's a pellet gun.
I called 911 to say it's a pellet gun, okay?
Who are you talking to, Susan?
I'm talking to the officer who set of rifle, are aiming up at me.
Oh god, I can't believe this is happening.
No.
I call 9-1-1 to tell them that he was...
Yeah, I'm shocked.
This is dead?
I cannot...
Oh, I can't believe he did that.
I just can't believe he did that.
I just can't believe he did that.
Do you want me to hang up?
Do you want me to stay on the phone with you, Susan?
No, I guess you don't have to.
Okay.
I'll let you talk to the officers.
All right, bye.
