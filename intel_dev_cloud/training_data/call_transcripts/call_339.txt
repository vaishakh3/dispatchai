What's that?
We have a lot of offices headed that way.
Okay, thank you.
Yeah.
I mean, a law enforcement supporter myself, I would say approach with caution,
but they know that, I assume.
Oh, yeah, they know.
They know.
He's just been in this situation, and he will follow through with the suicide.
Yeah.
What makes him doing this?
Have you been going through a lot of different stories of life, or do you know?
He's been a heavy depressed of his whole life.
Oh, okay.
He's a good person, but we've been through this a lot in our lives,
Burke and in our life with him.
Well, he's young.
Yeah?
He's not old, that's so.
I know, but he's now around the backside of the house,
and I don't have a visual on him.
That's okay.
So he's northwest facing now.
But he's still on the side.
five, right?
Correct, yes.
Does the porch wrap around the whole house?
It wraps around to the full back.
Full back?
Yeah, it wraps around the east side of the house and the full back of the house.
Okay.
And there's just a single front porch with stairs.
Okay.
And you said he has threatened before?
Do you know what they were in Alabama before, like officers or anybody?
Yeah, about 10 or 12 years ago.
He was in a hostage standoff, I think, with...
Oh, really?
Tempeer Scottsdale PD.
Oh, okay.
Where he barricaded himself in a hotel.
The police were forced to raid the room, and he shot at them.
To this time, he does not have any firearms.
Yeah, that's good.
So he's a little bit different, but he does have a history.
He's now on the lower side of the house, which is underneath the rear deck.
Okay.
Now, once office, someone gets.
I think I'll let you all hang up.
Yeah, I think someone else is calling.
Someone else had called him too.
You said lower deck?
Okay.

It's just a ground level.
Okay.
Ground bubble.
