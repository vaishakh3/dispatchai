I just called over to my sister's house and I have a felon that's over there and it's my
nephew and it's my sister's son and he just hung up on me and they're having a problem
over there and my brother-in-law had to take my sister out of the house and I would like
somebody sent over there, please.
Okay.
He just hung up on me and called me a bitch.
Okay.
It's not a good thing.
Right.
But, okay.
Ma'am.
He is on.
Ma'am.
What's going on?
I don't, I, I,
there's a bunch of stuff going on over there, a bunch of drinking.
My nephew is on, um, house arrest.
He's got an ankle bracelet.
He ran his, my sister, and her husband out of the house.
I think there needs to be something done over there.
Okay.
So what are you calling to report that they're drinking?
There's a problem, yeah.
Is he 21?
Oh my God, he's almost 30 years old.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
So, there's some violence going on over there around my sister out of the house.
I'm 51.
My sister's older than me.
Okay.
Did she, why isn't she calling us then?
Because her husband took her out there because Jay is violent.
Okay.
J.
D. Hay is violent.
They're scared of him.
Because you're not in the house.
He called me a bitch.
I'm 51 and I'm his aunt.
Okay.
He's a violent son of a gun.
He's on house arrest over there.
He's a felon.
He's out of control.
He told me they left the house because of him.
She did, or?
And he called me a bitch.
That's fine.
But there needs to be something done over there.
He's on house arrest.
He's a felon.
Okay.
He needs to quit his drinking.
If he's drinking while he's on house arrest, that's his probation officer.
Oh, we can run my sister who's in her 50s out of her freaking arles for her husband.
Because he's a scary son of a guy.
We're not hearing from kicked her out.
Yeah, she called me.
You said he told you that.
She called me too before that.
Okay.
I said I'm scared.
Okay, so how she can call?
I don't know, honey. I don't know.
I don't know what you want us to do because there's nothing is drinking.
Is this probation officer?
He's violent.
He's violent.
Yeah, probably.
Because we can't just go.
Well, we're his parents of the house.
I don't know.
We can't do.
And he's gone to and everything and nothing can be done.
No, there's, ma'am, there's nothing we can do if, if your sister wants to go.
call us and tell us that beginning the third party?
Yeah?
There's not a lot we can do.
Her husband took her out of there.
Okay.
His dad.
And mother, he's scary.
Oh, I don't know.
You know, I'm not there.
My sister has called me.
There's other people there.
Who knows?
Right, but is it causing a disturbance right now?
Yeah.
She said he was getting violent.
That's why she left.
Okay.
He was getting violent with the people there right now?
What's that?
He was getting violent with your sister there right now?
Yeah.
Wouldn't you call me?
Yeah.
Okay.
He's vulnerable.
He just got out of that boot cap stuff.
He's been doing meth and everything else.
See this student's house with her.
My sister's scared death.
Is your sister even there to talk to us?
No.
Her husband took her out of there.
Okay.
Is there anyone there that can talk to us?
I don't know.
And if you call there, I don't know who you'll get.
Right.
No.
We can go over there and see if there's a problem.
And if everybody tells us that there's no problem there,
there's nothing we can do.
He just hung up on me. I called over there and I said, what the hell?
Are you doing too much?
Him hanging up on you is an illegal.
He can hang up on whoever he wants.
I know, but it's not his phone.
And he's got a monitor there and he's on a house arrest.
It's her, ma'am. I already told you that.
If you want to talk to his probation officer tomorrow about...
Go to that, man.
That's stupid asshole, like great mizinkle off.
Forever in a day.
Oh, yeah. Thanks a lot.
No.
Sister wants to call us and talk to us.
I just thought you guys would do something.
Sister.
People are selling for Christ's sake.
What can't do nothing?
No.
It's not his own home.
Is your sister letting him live there?
He's 28, freaking, or 29 years old.
My God.
If your sister is letting him live there, it is his home.
It is his home until...
Tell the list she evicts him.
So she asked you victim.
She asked you go through the court system and evict him if that's what she wants.
Okay.
If she wants to call us and tell us that.
He is.
Okay, you go ahead and us the call.
He was going over there.
Anyway, but thank you.
You're welcome.
Good match.
Uh, yes.
Uh, this is the city police department?
Yes, is there.
Dispatch.
Senator, can I help you?
Uh, yeah.
I'd like to get a hold of somebody that can meet me and my wife over at our house, you
know, and kind of evict our son and his friends.
So we can get back in the house.
He's 29.
Okay.
And he lives there with you?
Yeah, he's there on parole.
He's got that, what you call that, ankle bracelet.
