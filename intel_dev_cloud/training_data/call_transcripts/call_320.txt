He's mostly okay, but I'm holding my dear rifle on him.
I mean, I'm not going to let him attack me again.
I need the police up here now.
So your wife will know where he's at where you're at?
Yes, my wife will know where I'm at.

Is that correct?
That is correct.
Okay.
And what else do you see around you, Jeff?
You're on a hill.
Yeah, I'm near the top of a rise on a hill.
And all I have is an overgrown logging road and trees all around.
There's no wide visibility at this particular spot.
Okay, an old logging road and trees?
Yes.
Okay.
Yes.
So do you see any, a lot of times logging roads will have numbers on them?
No, there's no numbers on these roads.
No numbers at all.
This road will wind down and come out at a blue gate on.
There's a blue logging gate at there on the left that would lead the police up here.
if they wanted to drive up that through that gate.
But the gate's locked.
You're going to have to have a key.
We'll draw, that will allow
to drive up logging road.
Let the gate.
Have them get hold of my wife.
She can direct them up here quicker than anybody.
Okay, and she knows where you're at then.
Yes, she does.
Perfect.
Hold on.
Okay, she says she doesn't know where you're at.
Well, let me, can you pass me through to her
and let me talk to her?
Is there any way to do that?
I can try to conference in.
What is your phone number?
Well, it's 9-3-
Hold on, hold on really quick, sir.
Don't hang up.
Hold on really quick.
Okay, okay.
Hold on.
Hang on.
Okay.
Okay, so go ahead with her phone number.
Okay, her phone, what do you mean go ahead with her phone number?
What we're going to do is I'm going to conference you in.
She's answering the house phone, is that right?
Yeah.
Okay, what's that number?
That number is just where I'm at in a minute.
Hang on, all right.
Okay, hang on here.
Okay.
Okay, Deborah?
Deborah, it's neat.
Yes, I can hear you, honey.
Yeah, I got the sh-
by a crazy man, a naked man in the woods.
Oh, my God.
I'm on top of the hill.
I'm just up the road, you know, like you were going.
over the hill to the nuclear cut or something,
I'm right at the top of the hill on that
logging road, and so is he.
Okay, now they're walking up there and following your
quadracks, but I didn't know if you went left or right
out of the quad. I think he trashed the quad.
I found that he had a bloody
saw, my pruning saw in his hands
when I found him, but
anyway, yeah, they just need to follow the road
up on top the hill and get up here.
Yes, because they can, okay?
Deborah, hold on. Guys, stop for a second.
I know that this is scary, and I appreciate
you guys being so cooperative here.
Deborah, do you know where he's talking about?
I do.
Okay, so are you going to be able to show the deputies?
They're ahead of me now, but I'm going to go up after him.
Okay, what kind of car are you in?
Okay, I'm going.
Okay, what kind of car are you in, Debra?
I can't drive up there.
I have to walk.
You can't drive.
Okay, I'm sorry.
Okay, so you're going to start walking now.
I'm going to start walking.
What's going to have a wireless phone?
I do have my wireless phone.
I'm going to lose signal, but you can probably text to me, and I'll go out.
What I'm wondering is if I drop, okay, you can do, okay?
Okay, please.
All right, bye-bye.
Is he cooperative with you?
Yes.
And you have your weapon there, right?
Yes, I do.
Okay. When we come up, do us a favor and just make sure you're following all the commands
to be told you, we'll probably tell you to drop the gun and all that.
Absolutely, no problem, but don't.
Then I'll notice he's only 20 feet from me, so let's not drop it, have him pick it up.
Perfect.
No, yeah, we'll take care of that when we get there.
Okay, sounds good.
So we're going to leave from the house on foot towards you, okay?
It sounds like that's the best way to get to you.
That is the best way, yes.
And we're taking those logging roads and the trails out there
and your wife knows how to get to you.
Yeah, she can guide you right to me.
Okay, perfect.
We'll be there as soon as we can.
Okay, thank you.
Okay, I'm going to go ahead and disconnect then, okay.
Are you done here?
Yeah, I'm still here.
Okay, good.
I'm letting him know that you can hear them and see them.
Okay, blow the whistle right now every 20 seconds.
Okay
You copy
Every 20 seconds
Blow the whistle
All right
Do you hear anything
Jeff?
All right
I'm going to hang out
Bye
They're here

One operator
Police are here

Thank you so much
You take care
Okay
Yes
Okay
Okay
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
All I can understand.
I think I can...
I just kind of want to stand back.
Okay, I guess...
No comment.
Okay.
That's okay.
He was running naked through the woods.
He had my pruning.
