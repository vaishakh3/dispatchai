Yes, ma'am.
I'm calling from the Sheraton, Baltimore North.
Yes, sir.

Okay, I can help you.
Let me take some information so we can go ahead and give the help out there.
What's the address?
The address is 903, the Lady Valley Valley Road.
The Sheridan Hotel, correct?
That's correct.
Okay, 903, the Lady Valley Road off a Fairman Avenue.
That's correct.
What room number?

In your name, sir?
My name is.
In your work here, sir?
Yes, ma'am.
And the phone number you're calling us from?

Okay.
Do you know if it's a male or a female?
It's a male.
But they're definitely beyond help?
Yes.
Any idea how this might have happened?
I don't know. I'm not going further into the room than what I just saw on the floor on the entrance.
Okay. I would have let you know that we have already sent a call for police fire and ambulance to be on the way up there.
If you do find any more information and we're not out, just give us a call back in.
If you don't want to go in the room, definitely don't.
