I had really a hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard time sleeping.
Okay, so you haven't been to sleep tonight, and why is your family up at this time of the morning?

Have you ever had any type of thoughts of doing this before?
Never, never, ever, ever.
it just hit me like a brick in the face.
I don't even know why I did it.
I don't even have a valid reason.
Michael, I'm hoping that you're just dreaming this.
I pray to God, this is a dream.
Okay.
I hope to God this is a dream.
