Did he say why he broke in?
What, ma'am?
Did he say why he broke in?
Hell, he wanted to fucking money.
Just wanted money.
He worked for a goddamn living, and he comes in here trying to steal our goddamn money.
We had a whole $50 dollars and be sure like that.
You're going to jail.
And you said there was a second suspect or he didn't?
My mom's fine.
He kept telling us they had somebody in there with her.
Okay.
Come on, man.

We're going to shoot his ass to click.
He goes, a ton of this thing loaded, and I don't know nothing else, Jeff.
You're going to go ahead.
They're coming up bell club pretty quick, I know.
I don't understand this, ma'am.
We work hard for us, limit.
We don't bear all now.
We don't mess with nobody.
We feed ourselves.
I don't know why it's because.
We kill my son.
We have $50.
Over $50.
You're going to kill us for $50.
You know what I get my goddamn jewelry out of your pocket to you.

As soon as they get him secure.
They should be pulling up into your driveway, you know.
Okay.
as you can point into your driveway any second, okay?
Can you see anything out the window?
I can't see nothing.

Is there any way that you can go to the front door?
Can you hold him?
Is that possible?
Move on.
What are the floor?
Don't move, Mr.
Don't move, mister.
No, I'm not telling you.
Do they have permission just to make an entry, ma'am?

And I'm here.
Where's the shit?
Is he there?
Do you see them?
They're checking out on scene, ma'am.
Do you see them?
I don't even know how the guy can't go out of the house.
It's pretty secluded.
I don't know anything or anything either.
I'm telling it's me running out.
The goddamn knife in my hand.
So they'll shoot me.
Okay, what are you in?
I'm standing in front of my mind.
I didn't have to jammer.
I'm opening my gate for them.
I don't think the people will do it.
I'm sorry.
Okay.
