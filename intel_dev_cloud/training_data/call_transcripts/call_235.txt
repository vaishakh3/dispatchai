Let me want that one.
The top, I'm sorry, I'm going to be.
What is it? Where are you at?
Oh my name?
Oh my God, come on.
No, my address that's where you're at.
Huh?
You need the address.
449.
Oh my God, the apartment.
Oh my God.
Why?
What apartment?
What apartment is?
What's the name of the apartment complex?
Okay.
And what's on fire?
I don't know.
Okay.
Something in the other one?
No.
All right.
What I need you to do is get everybody out.
Your neighbor's out also, okay?
I can't do.
I can't get in there.
I need you to get everybody out of the apartment.
I can't get in there, I can't breathe.
I'm trying, who's in the apartment?
My daughter, I'm not the kids.
Is the door on the door locked me?
What is the door locked me?
What?
Listen, I need you to get out of there.
I don't know.
I don't know.
God!
How?
You know?
The whole time I got my kid,
I did a great girl!
Oh my God!
Oh my God!
Oh my God!
Oh my God!
Oh my God!
Oh my God!
Oh my God!
Oh my God!
What's the other else in here?
I'm in this one.
Oh my God!
Oh my God!
Oh my God!
Oh my God!
I'm going to get me.
I can't understand.
I'm like a lot of thinking.
You know?
Oh, do you know?
Oh!
I don't know if you're talking about me.
Wait, what is it?
I don't know.
I don't know why I can't get me.
You're fucking kidding me!
Oh my God!
Oh my God!
Yeah, should I get it?
I can get it.
