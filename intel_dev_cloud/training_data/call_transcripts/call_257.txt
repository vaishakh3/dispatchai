Are you bringing our 29-11?
What is the address to your emergency?
Hi, this is calling from Captain Doug's Airboat Tour's Everglade City.
Uh-huh.
Our address is, I don't even know.
905 DuPont Road.
Okay.
We've had an airboat accident.
I'm not sure if there are injuries.
I don't know to what extent right now.
We've got somebody bringing the injured back to our dock.
We just need a deputy and ENF.
Do you know how many people were on board?
I don't know how many people were on the boat.
I don't know how many were injured.
I've got a captive from another company bringing the injured to my dog now.
Okay.
And then we've got other people also on the boat.
I just don't know yet until they get here.
He had a total of six people on his boat when he left the dock.
Okay.
So, you see, we're up to six.
I just don't know how many.
Move Wally's people to Kent and put them with Jerry.
And I'll go tell Wally's people where you're on phone today.
Sorry, we're crazy right here.
That's all right.
Okay, I think the boats are coming in now.
If you could just tell me the extent of the injuries.
I don't have any idea.
No, I mean, if they're coming right now.
Yeah, they're all, well, they're not at my dock yet.
They're still out in water.
Oh, wait a minute, I might be telling you the story.
Here comes a captain with them now.
Hold on.
Let me get outside.
Oh, Jesus, Christ, here's my boat captain.
Oh, Jesus, Lord Christ.
It looks like he's lost his hand.
Oh, my George.
Yes.
It's about captain himself.
He's lost his hand.
Can you get a dry, clean cloth?
I am now.
Yeah, I've got a two captains out there with him.
Okay?
Yeah, we've got a captain out there with him.
Is it totally off?
The way it looks to me, yes.
Like I said, I just, I'm trying to get two calls while they're out there.
Is everyone conscious or is it?
He's conscious.
Hold his hand up.
Two men are with him.
I'm here.
What?
I got it.
Oh, okay.
Okay, just have them lay down or sit on the floor.
Yeah, you're getting them in here now.
Okay.
Thank you.
Uh-huh.
