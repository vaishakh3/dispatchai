Okay, honey.
There's not guarantee that those medics are on duty.
How far up Seoul Lane?
Ma'am, I don't know.
We're up on top of the hill.
You're on a hill?
Is it out of a house that they're at?
No, they're up on hill and a mud hole in their bronco, too.
We've been looking for them for two days.
Oh, my God.
Is there any way somebody can meet them off the hill?
I can meet them down here and bring them up here.
That's the only thing I know to do.
Okay, where do you want to meet him at?
I'll come out with Wolfpen and Thaxton Huller.
I'm coming out there on a full-wheeler.
You're going to meet there at Wolfpen and Faxon and Holla?
Oh, my God.
Are they inside the vehicle?
Yeah, all three.
How many are in there, too?
Is it just David and Shane?
All right.
What's their name?
James. It's Dale, David, David, and Shane Gandy.
David and Shane Gandy. Yeah.
Does it look like what happened? Can you tell?
No there.
Huh? No.
No. Does it look like any, like, done or anything's been used?
No. No. It's sucking them at home.
Okay. Just, just down the phone with first thing. Hey, I've got them on the way, okay?
And they're in a Bronco, correct?
Yeah.
Okay. And does it look like somebody's done anything to them?
No. No. But they're definitely not for even, correct?
No, man.
Are they cold to touch? Have they not ever been to touch them?
Yes, they are.
Okay. Don't see any drugs or anything, do you?
No.

And is your phone number six?
Yeah, that's my son. I'll give you mine.
