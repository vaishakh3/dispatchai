Number one, please start medical, what is it?
Is it a medical or what is it?
Here seems to be a bad fight next door.
One's on the grind, one just got up.
What address?
What address?
Our address is 5304 Milegall Road.
It's the highest next door.
Don't know if this one's going up to the other one again.
I think their last name is Cross or Crocs or called something like that.
Okay.
It's directly across the street or next door to you?
Right next door and there's a red truck.
There's something going on bad.
Hurry up.
He just, I don't know if he, he, I think he just ran them over in the red car.
He's right in there over.
He ran over somebody?
He's running over.
Or him.
Yes.
Get on there.
Yes, he's running them over in the driveway.
Oh, please, hurry up.
There I ran around, ma'am.
Listen to me.
Listen to me.
I need to.
Right next door.
He's right now.
Ma'am.
We're up and running them over.
Ma'am, you've been so calm.
Let's stay calm because you help me when you're calm.
So the person is running.
Running him over repeatedly in a truck.
Okay.
We're right next door.
All right.
If I'm looking at your house, I'm standing there looking at your house.
Is it on the right or the left?
It's on the right.
Looking at your house, it's on the right.
It's on the right.
And it's a red cheese that seems to be doing this.
I'm waiting.
Help!
Please, please.
They're already in route.
What's your name, ma'am?
My husband's going out with a gun.
Please hurry up.
They're already in route, ma'am.
They're already in route, ma'am.
What's your phone number?
2807314.
Bill, get over here.
Hurry, please.
Ma'am, again.
Please.
They're already en route.
I can't make them go any faster than what they're going.
They can't fly.
They're in cars.
Okay.
Is the person that was, ma'am, is the person that was ran over, are they getting up?
Did they get up?
Were they run over?
No, they weren't right up.
No, they weren't.
Ma'am, did your husband back inside with a gun?
Yes.
Yes, he is.
No, he isn't, I don't know what the boy went over.
Oh, he must...
What did he say?
Somebody hit the dog and killed the...
We thought it was another person, but he ran the guy's dog over.
We're not sure. Just please, hurry.
Ma'am, again, they're already en route.
I have to get this information that I can give them
while they're driving as fast as they can.
I know, but we're watching it.
I understand.
But getting upset and getting where I can't control the situation
does not help.
You being calm helps.
Okay.
So the person did not run over another human,
they ran over a dog.
We don't really know, but I think it was a dog.
I thought, whatever it was,
he was backing up on it, backing up.
But the truck is still there.
He didn't leave.
So maybe it was a dog.
I don't know.
So the suspect vehicle is a red jeep?
It looks like, is that a red jeep?
And do you know these people that are over there?
We do, but not well.
Do you not have any names for me?
What's their last name?
Especially the suspect's name.
Is it Josh Bill?
Josh is his first name.
That's a suspect?
I think.
We're looking through windows across the yard.
Right, I understand.
Do you see any weapons?
No, not yet.
We don't see nothing, but that Bill said it might have to be.
and said he's acting completely insane.
And I'll tell you what, about two, three years ago,
his dad had shot himself over there.
Maybe that would help.
Okay.
All right.
We're right on my ground, right across from the field.
No, I don't have a problem finding you.
I didn't ask where you were.
I've got that.
So they're en route.
They're coming lights and sirens.
They're going as fast as they can without,
you know okay do you want us to set up our house alarm for what no let me just talk to him okay
let me talk to your husband hello hi is your name bill yeah all right i already know where you are
you're at 5304 mount gallant road when i look at your house she said that the people fighting are
on the right-hand side i don't have a problem with that and my officers are coming as fast as they're
can and they have been as soon as she gave me the address. So the questions that I'm
asking her are not because we don't know where y'all are. We're trying to figure out what's
going on in that yard because you guys are our eyes. Do you understand?
Well, all I've seen is, I thought somebody drug his dog up there. They might have hit his dog
and he went berserk, I think. I ain't sure. But I thought his mother is beating on. I don't
know. Because it looked like a woman with him when I seen him
first time.
All right.
All right.
Well, they should be there shortly.
Is there anything else happening now?
No, but if he comes over here, I'm going to shoot him.
Well, I'm not questioning you about what you do with they come breaking in your house.
That, you know, I'm not, I never even came up.
I didn't ask that question.
So I'm asking what's going on in that yard where you see people getting hit.
I don't see people getting hit.
So did they leave or did they go in that?
house? No, he went in the house. I went outside. So the setback, Josh, went in the house? Yeah. He went
around back or in the house. He ain't out there in the yard, and I can't see him. All right,
do you happen to have Josh's last name? No, I don't know. Okay. All right, so if there's
anything else that happens, you can either call us back on number one because you say you don't see anything going on
correct?
No, the car's still there.
All right.
They're not running.
I can't see if...
So it's like a Jeep type?
It's a little like a GMC.
A Jeep, like a Rango or a, not a Rangel but a SUV.
Okay.
All right, then.
All right.
If anything changes, give us a call back on 911.
Thank you, sir.
All right.
Bye.
