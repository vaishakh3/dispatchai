And the one that's crying, have they been hit?
Um, no, they haven't been hit.
She, the instructor.
Okay.
Yeah, if you came.
Ms. Cloud out.
Okay, he saw me.
Okay.
Hi.
Yeah.
I was the instructor at the front of the class.
I've got three down.
I'm not sure if they're all dead, but I'm pretty sure.
I can't get sent out security came in.
What happened?
I had a student.
that had withdrawn from the program, and she was looking for help,
and she came to me earlier, and I sent her to students to find out of her transcripts,
and then she went to somebody else's office, and then she walked in the back of my office,
and I said, just have a seat for a minute until I can't have the rest of these tests.
And, you know, the rest of the test she started shooting,
and I just hit the ground, and when I turned around, everybody else hit the ground with me,
And when I got up, she was rolling the thing on the gun.
We'll see a black or white female?
Black, heavy set, real curly hair.
She's one of them that's down because she shot two other people and then shot herself.
Okay.
And what room were they in?
The room that she was shooting in.
So there's a one she was shot in.
Do I know that?
It's E&T class.
Across from 282?
No.

283?
I got to go to the police.
Okay.
All right.
