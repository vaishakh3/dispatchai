Okay, do you, is there any reason that you were so angry at your mother and your sister?
Uh, I don't know.
I wasn't
It's weird
I wasn't even really angry with them
It just kind of happened
I've been kind of
planning on
killing for a while now
The two of them or just anybody
Pretty much anybody
Why
I don't know
I
I
I don't really like people's kind of attitude.
Right.
I think they're kind of, they're very, like, you know, emotional, I don't know,
verbally rude to each other and stuff like that.
Right.
And I don't know.
It's okay.
It's just my family, I don't know.
They're just kind of really, I guess this was really selfish to say, but to me, they, I felt like they were just suffocating me in a way. I don't know. I, I think I'm, obviously, you know, I'm pretty, I guess, evil, but that's, you know, whatever.
Okay.
No, don't be sorry. It's all right. I'm listening.
Okay, you have my undivided attention.
Were your mom and sister in their beds?
This is really going to mess me up for this, you know, in the future.
See, my sister, I told my sister that my mom needed her.
He was in her room and she came out of her room and I shot her.
and she rolled down the stairs
and I shot her again
and then I went down and I shot my mom
about maybe three or four times
but I'll never forget this
my sister
she came down the stairs
and she was screaming
and I was telling her that I'm sorry
but to just hold still
that you know I was just scared
going to make it go away, you know, but she just kept on freaking out. But finally, she fell
down and I shot her in the head about probably three times.
So they're both downstairs?
Yes.
Okay. Where are you?
In the kitchen.
Okay.
You're not sitting by the gun, are you?
No, it's about like 10 or 15 feet away from the kitchen.
That's all right
Where's your dad
He's out of town
Do you know where he is?
Out of town
Washington D.C.
Okay
And
For I guess future reference
I don't really went
To see
Any of my family members, you know
Like it
And visiting or whatever
I don't know how it works or anything, but I just don't want any type of visitors.
I don't want to see.
Okay.
Where do you go to school, Jake?
Well, I used to go to Lado High School, but now I'm kind of being homeschooled.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So there's just you and your sister and your mom and dad in the house?
Well, no, my dad's out of town.
Well, yeah, but normally it's just your mom and your sister and your dad and you.
Yeah, and my grandpa and grandma, they live across the street,
and my oldest sister, she lives with my grandparents,
and I have another sister, and she's out in college.
She was going to come out to visit us tomorrow.

You don't want to hurt yourself, do you?
I'm a little freaked out about guns now.
Oh, sure. But you don't want to hurt yourself.
I, you know, I assure you I definitely don't like myself, you know.
But I'm just so freaked out by guns now.
And just to let you know, like, I hate the feeling of killing someone, you know, I'm going to be messed up.
