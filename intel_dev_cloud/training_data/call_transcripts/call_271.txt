You just killed your mother and your sister?
How did you do that?
I shot him with a 22 revolver.
And what is your name?

Okay.
I want you to stay on the phone with me, okay?
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Okay. Hold on just a minute.
Where is the gun?
It's on the kitchen counter.
Okay.
Okay.
It's a 22?

Okay.
Hold on.
Jake, hold on.
Stay on the line with me, okay?
All right.
Jake?
Yes.
Are you on any kind of medication?
No.
Well, I've been going to the allergist a lot lately.
Yeah.
But no, nothing other than that.
Okay.
How old are you?
17.
You don't take any other kind of medication?
I mean, other than like Zyrtec and like Advil and, you know, like, stew to pet and stuff
like that, you know, for allergies and headaches.
Yeah.
Okay, do you, is there any reason that you were so angry at your mother and your sister?
Uh, I don't know.
I wasn't
It's weird
I wasn't even really angry with them
It just kind of happened
I've been kind of
planning on
killing for a while now
The two of them or just anybody
Pretty much anybody
Why
I don't know
I
I
I don't really like people's kind of attitude.
Right.
I think they're kind of, they're very, like, you know, emotional, I don't know,
verbally rude to each other and stuff like that.
Right.
And I don't know.
It's okay.
It's just my family, I don't know.
They're just kind of really, I guess this was really selfish to say, but to me, they, I felt like they were just suffocating me in a way. I don't know. I, I think I'm, obviously, you know, I'm pretty, I guess, evil, but that's, you know, whatever.
Okay.
No, don't be sorry. It's all right. I'm listening.
Okay, you have my undivided attention.
Were your mom and sister in their beds?
This is really going to mess me up for this, you know, in the future.
See, my sister, I told my sister that my mom needed her.
He was in her room and she came out of her room and I shot her.
and she rolled down the stairs
and I shot her again
and then I went down and I shot my mom
about maybe three or four times
but I'll never forget this
my sister
she came down the stairs
and she was screaming
and I was telling her that I'm sorry
but to just hold still
that you know I was just scared
going to make it go away, you know, but she just kept on freaking out. But finally, she fell
down and I shot her in the head about probably three times.
So they're both downstairs?
Yes.
Okay. Where are you?
In the kitchen.
Okay.
You're not sitting by the gun, are you?
No, it's about like 10 or 15 feet away from the kitchen.
That's all right
Where's your dad
He's out of town
Do you know where he is?
Out of town
Washington D.C.
Okay
And
For I guess future reference
I don't really went
To see
Any of my family members, you know
Like it
And visiting or whatever
I don't know how it works or anything, but I just don't want any type of visitors.
I don't want to see.
Okay.
Where do you go to school, Jake?
Well, I used to go to Lado High School, but now I'm kind of being homeschooled.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So there's just you and your sister and your mom and dad in the house?
Well, no, my dad's out of town.
Well, yeah, but normally it's just your mom and your sister and your dad and you.
Yeah, and my grandpa and grandma, they live across the street,
and my oldest sister, she lives with my grandparents,
and I have another sister, and she's out in college.
She was going to come out to visit us tomorrow.
Okay.
You don't want to hurt yourself, do you?
I'm a little freaked out about guns now.
Oh, sure. But you don't want to hurt yourself.
I, you know, I assure you I definitely don't like myself, you know.
But I'm just so freaked out by guns now.
And just to let you know, like, I hate the feeling of killing someone, you know, I'm going to be messed up.
There are people that will help you.
Oh, God.
Well, you just take a deep breath.
We have deputies coming, and they're going to help you.
We're here to help you, too.
Okay.
We're going to help you.
We're not going to hurt you.
I understand if you'll want to, you know.
No, we're not going to hurt you.
We're there to help you, Jake.
All right.
Everybody thinks that, you know, we want to do bad things, but we don't.
We want to help people.
Right or wrong, we want to help people.
And we're going to help you.
Okay?
Do you understand that?
Yeah.
We're also here to help.
Okay.
Jake, where is the kitchen in the house?
Is it the back of the house?
Yeah, kind of to the back, I guess, yeah.
Okay.
We're talking with our sergeant now.
He's almost at your house,
but we'll probably, what I'll probably ask you to do, Jake?
When he get there, turn your porch light on.
All right.
Okay, and what he'll probably do is ask you to come out, okay?
Okay.
Okay, so you'll be all right.
You're going to be all right.
Okay?
All right.

Are you okay, Jake?
I'm just thinking about my sister.
Yeah, how old is she?
15?
She was, I don't know.
She had a really sweet side, but, you know, she was kind of racist and, I don't know,
kind of rude to me sometimes, I don't know.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, man.
How long ago did this happen or how long ago did you, you shoot your sister and mom just a while ago?
Yeah.
When you called?
30, 30 minutes ago?
About 30 minutes ago.
About 30 minutes ago.
Okay.
You'll be all right, Jake.
Okay?
You'll be all right.
I'm, like, really worried about, like, you know, like, nightmares and stuff like that.
Are there any type of medication for that and stuff?
Well, I think there is.
I don't know.
I'm not a doctor, but, you know, the justice system,
and I'm sure your family will get you the support you need.
I don't mean to sound like a limp or anything, but, you know, this is, wow.
I've never, like, done anything violent in my whole life, you know?
You don't sound like a violent person.
No, you don't.
But help will be provided for you, medical and psychological.
That'll be provided to you, okay?
So you don't have to worry about that right now.
Take deep breaths for me, okay?
You're doing fine.
In through your nose and out through your mouth.
So you don't hyperventilate, okay?
And that'll slow down your heart right, too.
I'm sure it's just jumping all over in your chest.
There you go.
A couple more.
Good.
That sounds good.
You sound a lot calmer right now.
Just keep taking deep breaths.
And it'll keep the anger.
anxiety down. Are there any cars in your driveway, Jake?
No.
No cars in the driveway? Okay. Deep breath, honey. In through your nose, real deep.
