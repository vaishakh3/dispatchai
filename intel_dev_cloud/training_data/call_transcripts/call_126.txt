There's three on the jewelry side, which is where shooting came from,

Yes, yes.
All right.
I'm going to stand the line with you until they get there, okay?

Okay, I can hear them coming.
I can hear them, too, but I'm not going to hang up until you're actually with them, okay?

Okay, can I call my other partner? He's in another location.
Yep.
Okay, thank you. Bye.
