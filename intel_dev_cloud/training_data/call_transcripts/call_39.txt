9-1-1, where is your emergency?
I'm sorry.
Actually, I'm wanted for a crime, and I want to tell myself in.
You wanted for what type of a crime, sir?
To be honest with you, I don't know what they're calling it.
I got drunk and I attacked somebody.
What town of the security?
I'm sorry, what?
What town?
Yeah, it's done more.
Do you know if there's a warrant out for your arrest, or?
I, honestly, I don't know.
Where are you located at right now?
Right now, I'm at the Shell gas station.
I don't know the name of the street.
It's right by Ricardo's little mini market right down the road here,
and there's a Joe's Quick Mart here.
So you're in a 1,200 block of Wheeler Avenue?
I believe so, yeah, right down the road from Ohio.
1219, right?
I'm sorry, what?
1219 Wheeler Avenue you're at in Dunmore, right?
I believe so, yeah.
What's your last name?
It's Lake, L-A-E.
And where did this happen at?
In Dunmore.
What's your first name?
It's Charles.
And you're at the Shell Station?
Yes.
And the phone of your calling from is 9618109?
I'm sorry, what?
9618109 is the phone number you're calling from?
Well, actually, I'm in front of the quick mark.
The Joe's Quick Mart.
Okay.
All right?
Watch for the police.
We'll send them over in front of Charles, right?
All right.
Well, I'm going to walk over in front of the Shell so that there's no promotion over here
because they're closing up and doing whatever they've got to do in this for.
All right, watch for the police.
All right.
All right.
