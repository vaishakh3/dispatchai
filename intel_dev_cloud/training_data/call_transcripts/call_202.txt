and if they have it, they have it put out with their fire extinguisher.
Okay, so you don't need a fire truck out?
No, but we didn't know that they were up there.
We went and off the door just to make sure because I built an attack
and the smoke was doing out of the door, but it was coming out of the doors
and the windows, and I had ambrose coming out of the door.
James, they said they put out.
Yeah, the caller's on the phone saying the fire got put out with an extinguisher.

Oh, all right, that's fine.
That's good.
Okay.
All right.
Oh, bye.

The fire department and the police station came, but the guy would not come out to the door,
so they busted in the door.

They might be trying to clear out the building, okay?
No, they're still shooting.
They're still shooting.
They're still shooting.
Okay, I'll stay on the phone with you, ma'am.

Okay?
So, and that way you can just let me know what you hear and I'll let you know what I hear, okay?
Okay.
But, yeah, I went ahead and advise them that, you know, you're in apartment.
Okay, and I told them that I told you to go to the back of the apartment for your safety and that they will come up there once everything's settled down.
I haven't, in the closet in the front of that room because I'm scared.
Did it come out?
Okay.
Well, when they do come to your door, I will let you know that it's the officer at your door,
okay?
But yeah, they will definitely come ensure that you're safe once they get there, you know,
once everything's out of control, okay?
Okay.
Okay.
Is there anybody else stay in the apartment with you?
No, it's just me and I have two cats.
Okay.
Where's your cat?
Your cat safe?
When I was in the closet with me and when I'm in the bathtub and the bathroom.
Okay.
Okay.
Got scared him?
Yes.

What's got you?
My name is Issa and the other is Eby.
Okay.
Oh, God.
I don't hear anything, nobody talking or anything now.
But it's quiet?
Yeah.
Okay.
You know what they're sending up more police?
Uh, yes, they are.
Not like somebody knocked on the door, but I don't know.
Oh, yeah.
You know, it was just like a bomb.
Oh, okay.
Okay.
No, the room does, but I'm in the closet.
Okay.
Go ahead.
I'll have the door.
He's going to try to come in here.
No, I understand.
I understand.
I don't know if he can shoot through the lock or not.
Well, when it comes up to it, you know, any officers come up to your door, I'll let you know that it's set up at the door.
Okay.
Now that room you're at, is it facing the street?
Is it facing Cape Harbor or is it facing the back?
No, my room you're in, it's facing the back, yeah.
The room you're in, it's facing the back.
Yeah.
Well, my whole apartment faces the back.
Okay.
The guy that was in front of me that they're trying to get you facing the road.
You get his apartment face the road?
Okay.
I don't even know if there's a fire.
Did you see a fire at all?
No, but I could smell it.
And then I guess someone else, I'm sick, so I've been taking medicine and I'm congested.
I can't hardly bring me.
I kept smelling something, so I just kept checking to see if there was a fire or not, but I didn't see anything.
Do you have any smoke in your apartment?
No, no, I just smelled it.
I guess somebody else called in a fire.
No, I was just saying that I didn't want to become a hazard where, you know, you were breathing in smoke where you're at.
No, no.
You know, in case they have to come in the backside, you know, to make sure that they could get you out what they're still doing with him.
No, I'm trying to look at it.
No, I'm trying to look here and still don't have an update yet.
They're still trying to secure this.
Where do you have to go up the front stairway past his apartment to get to the place?
No, that's the back stairway, but he was on the end of the police shooting.
I don't really want to cry.
No, no, I was saying, I was only asking that so the officers could possibly take an alternative.
that route to get to you instead of coming up the front.
You know what I mean?
Try to go around the back of the building and coming to your apartment.
So were you on the second floor?
You're on the third floor.
Okay.
Can you hear anything?
No, nothing.
Okay.
Yeah, just let me know what you hear, okay?
Okay.
Okay, if you do hear something.
I'm beside him and then there's four apartments per floor.
There's four up there.
I'm beside him and then there's two across from us.
Do you know if there, any of the other people are home at all?
I don't.
Okay.
Do what, ma'am?
Okay.
That's fine.
Okay.
I'm in the room that I'm in like a snowy thing anyway.
Okay.
It's closer to the front of the apartment.
Okay.
No, it's just...
Okay.
Okay.
Knock him on the door.
I know.
They want you to go open it, okay?
Are you sure?
Yep.
I have cats.
Where do I go?
I don't have a key.
I'm going to let you go, ma'am.
