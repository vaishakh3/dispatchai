Do you know if any neighbors are up?
Oh.

They're on the way.
Okay, I just take a deep breath for me, so you, and I need you to call.
Calm down.
I live right behind them.
What the hell?
What the hell?
All right.
Go ahead and if the door's popped open, that way at least, and then when you go up to your apartment, leave the door open.
It's open, it's wide open.
It's your apartment door.
It's wide open.
Go ahead back upstairs.
If you've got the outside door open, go ahead upstairs.
Go ahead upstairs.
And then you go check to make sure he's still breathing.

He's snoring
He's probably
sleeping
Has you been drinking any alcohol
the night?

I hadn't been around
How would that work
All right
And he came home
And he came home
And he was all
All drunk
And
Oh my God
Okay, that's probably going to let the ambulance know that he was heavily intoxicated.
Okay.
That's probably what it is, okay?
So just taking deep breath and relax.
Because he was going to get in the shower and then the next thing, I know he just started throwing up.
I'm sure he just drank too much.
Oh, Lord.
I'll pray to God.
He told me that.
Oh, my.
God.
Oh, my God.
Why are they taking them?
Oh, my God.
What the hell did this move back?
