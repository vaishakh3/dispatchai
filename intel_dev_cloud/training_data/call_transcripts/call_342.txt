Good morning.
Police is this an emergency or can you hold?
It's an emergency.
I think it's an emergency.
It sounds like we have gunshots off of Southwest 9 in Vermont.
Yes, we've got calls about Creston.
There's a fellow on Creston Avenue that's shooting weapons.
So just stay inside your house, okay?
Okay, thank you.
Uh-huh.
Bye.
Hello?
Hi, do you call 911.
Please.
You call 911.
Yes, my husband's on the phone.
There's a guy here with an assault rifle shooting at police,
and aiming at our house.
You said he's trying to shoot at your house?
He was aimed at the house and out.
The car is going on at Elston.
Okay.
How many shots has he?
He's fired at least 34 shots.
He's out there again.
Please, Larry.
We're all the way.
Can you give me a description of him?
He's got blind hair.
He's trying to score.
I see him.
He's right out.
And Danielle, this guy's out of the driveway now if you ain't see you know.
Get up and down the street.
Okay.
All right.
Stay in your house and lock.
your doors, okay? All right, we're on the way. Thank you. Bye. Bye.
Hello. Yeah, this is the police department. It's got a call from this number. Is everything okay?
Well, I'll tell you what the deal is. This wild man across the street, he's got an assault rifle,
and I bet he set off 30 rounds.
Get out in the living room. Oh, Jesus, he's naming the gun now. He's out in front of the house.
There, he's shot again. There are two more. Three more, four more.
Jesus.
He's a...
Oh my God.
He's shooting at the street.
Get out of the living room!
Yeah.
Anyway, he's nuts.
He is shooting at cars now out in the street.
He just shot at somebody.
It's like...
He shot at somebody?
Yeah.
Okay.
Now, he's shooting at somebody in cars?
Yeah.
That's...
The person I was shooting at, what do they look like?
Damn, I don't know.
Is he on the front porch?
Oh, can you hear it?
You hear the shots?
I can hear him.
Oh my God.
He's sitting on the back.
of his car out towards the street like he's reloading.
I'm afraid to stay here.
Uh-oh, cars going up the street here.
I'll let you know right in the second here.
Oh my God.
He is. He's going to shoot that.
Who's it shooting?
He's shooting at the car.
Oh my God.
That car just went by. He just shot at him.
Oh, he laid down the assault rifle.
I'm not saying the door. I'm afraid of this dude.
Oh, my God. Here's going to go.
close another car street.
All right.
He's got about four officers that aren't come up on them real quick.
Oh, damn!
He's shooting at that car too!
He's got camouflage pants on, but he's at the back.
He's facing towards the north.
He's sitting on the back end of a white van.
And I think he is...
Yeah, he's still by the van.
You still got the rifle.
Yeah, he's got something.
He laid down the other one, but he's laying down now,
kind of on the ground like a sniper.
He's a, I think, a Gulf War veteran, not positive.
But what's his name?
Steve.
Steve, what's his last name?
What is it?
Vogel, Stephen Vogel.
Is he laying down under the car?
No, now he's up nice.
Tell me exactly where he is and what he's on.
Okay, he's got the gun back up.
He's on the, it would be the north.
Uh, east corner of his house there.
Oh, my God.
Here we go again.
Oh, my God.
Is he shooting?
Yeah, he's shooting.
He's probably shot 60 rounds.
Okay.
Your officers, better be careful.
Oh, man.
He's shooting across the street, so he's shooting to the north.
But he's facing out the north from the house.
So he's shooting towards the north?
Yeah, yeah, now he is.
That's where the car is the rule, Creston.
He's on the south side of Creston, but he's shooting across the street.
All right.
Can you tell him to gun, he has?
It looks like to me he's got at least two.
Definitely a salt rifle some type.
There he goes.
Jesus.
Shoot again.
I got to get away from the front door.
I'm afraid because I can angrily see him.
But your officers could come up on Broad Street.
We got the whole entire block.
right now, so. Oh my God. I hope no more cars come by. I know he's shot at him.
If he had before I called, he probably shot 30 rounds off.
Nah, what's he doing now? Okay, I do not see him at all. So he's beyond
there. He was on the east side of his house facing north. There's a white band,
and I thought he went up to slide down. His backyard's fenced in. You know what?
Maybe he went back in to reload or something. I don't know. He lives right there where they
Just about where it was...
Nope, there he is.
All right.
He's still arms.
Back out, face of the north.
He's on the north side of the house again, facing the crest.
All right.
You still got the gun?
Hell yes, listen to him.
Hear him?
Oh, my God.
His yard is fenced in all the way, the back, all the way down.
From the south side, the west side, and the north side is all fenced in.
I got about 15 officers around.
that house right now. Okay. They want to come down here near this one. I don't know he'll start
shooting at us, but really don't need that. He's on the back side. It looks like I just don't see
him, but he's still shooting. Okay. You don't see him anymore? No. Okay. You moved around and I got
another caller. My partner's got him on the line. They're watching him now, so. Okay. I'll let you go.
Just stay in the house until he'll give you the all clear, okay? Okay. Thank you. Bye.
Yeah, I'm probably about shots fired.
Okay, we're at, sir.
On the south side, it's a Glover, there's an alleyway over by Lincoln.
It looks like the corner of Glover and Creston, looks like he was out there drinking.
He's got a semi-automatic AR-15 and he is just lighting his face up.
Okay.
Has anyone been shot, sir?
I don't know, I can't see it.
I'm not going out of my house.
No, that's fine.
I just didn't know if you had seen anything.
We have several officers on the way, okay?
Just try to be aware.
He's got a semi-automatic.
It looks like AR-15.
He is shooting every...
I don't know what he's doing.
I can see the house.
I know the last name of the person.
I know someone who lives there.
It looks like his dad.
The last name is Vogel.
I don't know his first name.
Okay.
We're on the way.
Okay.
We should be there very shortly.
Just kick your doors locked and stay inside, okay?
Okay.
Okay.
9-1-1.
I need to report a neighbor firing a gun.
And you saw him.
Do you do this?
I'm watching him.
He's been firing this gun off of his deck back behind his yard.
Okay.
I had no idea.
I have no idea, but I can't.
It looks like a rifle of some kind.
There's no other people over there.
I don't know if he's into hunting or something, but I don't think you're going to
shoot your tongue right there in your yard.
No, no.
We're taking a lot of calls on it.
I just wanted to make sure we get the right house.
It just started maybe three or four minutes ago.
Okay.
Is he still out there with it?
Get down. Get down. I'm telling my kid to get away from the window.
Oh, that's understanding.
Hang on just a second.
Okay.
I can't see him from where I'm standing. He was on his back deck, but he's probably fired it 20 or 25 times by now.
And it did look like he was aiming it towards the backyard.
I do know his name if that helps.
Yes, that is very helpful.
His name is Steve Vogel, V-O-G, and I think it's E-L.
Steve, you said?
Yes.
Okay. Give you a second.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Did you see him leave or anything, or did you see any close?
No, he's firing it right now.
Did you see what he was wearing at all, ma'am?
I don't want you to get too close.
That's fine if you're just curious.
I don't see him anymore.
Okay.
You stand in line with the evening that starts again.
He must be.
Oh, Jesus.
Okay, well, now I see him.
Okay, he's standing in his driveway.
He's standing in.
in his driveway, right where I am, and he was aiming it up in the air.
He's wearing black and yellow sweatshirt, I think.
We got him coming, ma'am. We're not too far out.
You're staying the phone with me now. Is he still out in the driveway?
Yes, he's still firing.
I just can't believe he could be this stupid.
Is he still out front, ma'am?
I think so.
Okay.
I'm just afraid to get right up to the window because he's only a few feet away from my driveway.
Okay.
But he's firing right now.
No, I don't get too close to one of it, that's fine.
He just keeps popping him off.
He does appear to be in his front yard.
Okay.
What's going on now, man?
I haven't heard him saying for maybe a minute.
Okay.
I don't see him behind his house.
Okay.
I think he might still be laying down out in the front from what one of the other neighbors is telling us.
Do you mind please?
This is an emergency or can you hold?
Yes.
It's an emergency?
Where are you at?
It is an emergency, yep.
I've just been shot up.
Are you injured?
No.
Are you in a house or in a car?
I'm in a car.
Where are you at right now?
Right now, I am just off of southwest night.
I got out of where the tie was shooting at me.
Did he hit you?
He blew two holes through my windows.
Okay.
What kind of car are you in?
I'm in a Nissan Ultima.
What color?
Sky blue.
Where are you at right now?
Right now, hold on, let me.
I think I hear cops going on.
Yep, we're on our way there.
I just need to know where you're at so we can locate you when this is all wrapped up.
Okay, I'm on Broad Street, Broad and Southwest 7th.
I just got out of there.
Okay, that's fine.
And you are not injured, correct?
I want you to just assess yourself and make sure you haven't been struck by anything.
I got some glass cuts on my face.
Do you think you need an ambulance?
No, I don't need an ambulance.
Okay, all right.
I'm going to let them know where you're at.
You just hang tight there and we'll get you, okay?
Okay.
All right, bye.
