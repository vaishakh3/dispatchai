Hello?
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Do we know what's going on?
No, we just hear a female screaming and I hear a male in the background.
I don't know if he's trying to hear her.
Just see if you can make out what she's saying, okay.
She just said, Owl right here.
Oh, I'm scared.
I'm scared.
I'm sorry.
I'm scared.
I'm fat.
Oh, I'm scared.
I'm gone.
I hope so.
I'm going to get off.
Hello.
Hello.
Oh.
Are we getting another bid on her, 1020?
Oh, no, let me see, hold on.
Okay.
It's the same thing.
Same thing.
Somebody must go by.
Somebody must go by.
Do you hear that.
Hello.
Okay, I've been on the street right now.
Okay, the line is still open, but I don't hear anything.
Okay.
Just stay on the phone for just a second, okay?
She might have dropped the phone.
Has it rebid yet for address?
No, it was the same.
Okay.
All right, hold on just a second.
And it's not that far from where I hear it.
Get out of you.
That's the door's barking.
Did you?
Yeah, I know.
I didn't find the phone, there either.
Jeff, are you still there?
Yeah, I'm still here.
The phone is still open.
Okay, we found him. I'm sorry, we've just been busy up here, but we can go ahead and hang up, okay?
Okay, no problem.
Okay, no problem.
All right, thanks.
