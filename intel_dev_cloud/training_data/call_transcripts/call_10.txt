Ma'am, my pickup was stolen.
I had to go find it.
Please help us.
My girlfriend is really freezing out of cold.
We can't get out of here.
You can't get out of where?
We can't get out.
We don't know if we are...
They don't speak English or anything.
They don't talk to us.
Who?
These are people here.
So somebody's locked you in this building?
No.
But we don't know.
No, if we took the block from getting out of this building and walking, I cannot guarantee
it we'll make it before we freeze.
She's, I guarantee she can't.
She pissed her cat's twice, and she's frozen.
Sir, you're at 76 in Poppleton.
You don't have to walk very far to get somewhere, okay?
It's not like you're in the middle of nowhere.
Yeah, but we're at here, there's a quarter mile from, maybe a quarter mile from 75th.
That's all I'm saying.
Can you please just go in a little bit?
No, I can't help you.
Can I help yourself?
