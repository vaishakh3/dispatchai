911, what's the address of your emergency?
Yeah, I've just been bitten by, I think, a red-tail fox up in Red Reef Park.
You just were bitten by a fox?
Yeah.
I think he's rabid.
He came out of the woods crazy.
Red-Ree's a car.
I just killed him, though.
I have him here.
You killed him?
Yeah.
Okay.
I chased a sucker down.
He bit me and my wife both.
My wife just running down the road looking for somebody, they may get another call.
He's on the phone with me, okay?
Okay.
He's a quick sucker.
How are you feeling?
I'm all right.
You bit me in the calf.
He bit my wife in the knee.
Okay.
Did it just come up to you and bites you, sir?
He was crowing
And then he ran out of the bushes
And he bit my wife
And then I grabbed a piece of stick
And I chased him
And he bit me
And then I killed him after that
He was crazy
I don't even think it's a mother thing
Yeah, no
We just had a raccoon attack somebody down the street too
So there's something going on with the animals today
They might think
It might have been this thing
They might have thought it was a raccoon
because this guy was crazy.
Okay, yeah.
Sir, stay right there in the park, okay?
Don't move.
We're not at Red Reef.
I'm sorry.
No, no, yeah, we are at Red Reef.
We're in the North End.
So are you at the Red Reef Park, sir?
Red Reef Park, North End, yeah.
Yes.
At the North End?
I parked in South Beach, but we're in the Red Reef.
At Red Reef?
Yep.
At the North End.
And this just occurred like a minute ago?
Like five minutes ago.
It hit my watch.
Yeah.
Yeah, I think it was the same.
We have had a confusion.
We'll be right there, sir.
The firefighters right down the street.
Bye-bye.
Bye.
