Come on.
Yes.
No.
No, there's nothing to talk about.
9-1-1-1.
There's nothing to talk about.
Get away.
No, get away.
I don't know you, no.
You're not going to be.
I'm hanging up.
Come on, baby, Joe, come here.
Come on, come on me.
No, come my mama, come on.
No, you not leave your mama.
You're going to home.
Don't home. Don't leave me.
Just pull me back when you're going to talk to me.
