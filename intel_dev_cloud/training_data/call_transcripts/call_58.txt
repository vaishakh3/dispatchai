Where's 1091?
I think I need an ambulance. I've got a teenager. He's turning purple in his face. I think he's tooped out or something. I don't know.
How old is he?
He's 16.
And you don't know what's wrong with him?
What's wrong? Is it bad there?
No.
Oh, I need a name with bed. I don't think he's...
Is he breathing?
Is he breathing?
I don't know.
It's in purple.
It's 725 cream wood circle.
Okay, ma'am.
Calm down, calm down, okay?
Okay.
Just hang on here with me.
Okay.
Time 1 to Medicare priority traffic, 725 time would circle.
They're giving it mouth to mouth.
Hold on here, okay.
Okay, go down here.

10.
Does he have asthma or anything? What's wrong with him? Why are they not breathing?
I don't know.
How long has it been that? He's not been breathing.
Have he changed colors?
I don't know. He looks bad. He looks bad.
Does he have a pulse? Can you...
Not really.
Open airway, not too far, but still this slightly up.
And go ahead and feel your mouth or his mouth right over his mouth.
over the...
Wait, let me turn it to see it off.
I can't hear anything.
Okay.
Breathe in?
Yes, breathe.
Do you feel the air going in?
Let's take an ambulance so long.
We're not doing any good here.
Okay.
They're just now leaving.
I mean, it's only been like a minute.
Okay.
Okay, what you need to do is try to do CPR.
That's going to be the most important thing.
Well, you repeat that.
My radio is cutting out.
You're responding priority traffic.
Yes, take a full brief in and you should...
Did you see it go in?
Did you see it go in?
And put the hill of one hand on the center of his breastbone, right between the nipples.
And then take your other hand and put on top of that.
But that's important to at least think he'll need to give him two more breaths.
A fast breath, just slow, deep breaths in order to watch his chest right.
Until the ambulance gets there.
And he's going to get tired.
but he's got to keep on until the ambulance gets to say.
If he had the pulse, is he breathing?
Okay, when he breathed into his mouth, did his chest rise?
Not feel him breathing?
No.
Okay, go ahead and give him two more breaths.
Can you see his chest rise?
Because you want to make sure it's going in that there's not anything still?
He's not cold?
Okay, they're very close.
They're very close.
They're in the 900 blocks.
They're in the 900 blocks, so they're going to continue to do the two breaths versus 30.
Sorry, we're on saying.
Bye.
