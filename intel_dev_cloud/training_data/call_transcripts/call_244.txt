Okay, Sheriff's up.
This is 9-1-1 with a confirmed location of confirmed residential phone number.
Yes, but got involved.
Hello?
Hello.
Yes, sir.
I had a guy kicking in my door or trying to kick in my front door.
I don't know what his problem was.
My wife woke me up and said somebody was trying to kick in the door.
I looked out the window and told him to go away.
He kept trying to kick the door in.
So I opened the door.
see what his problem was because he looked kind of drunk and he charged me.
I had my firearm.
I told him to stop.
He took off his shirt and then charged me again so I shot him.
Okay.
He was inside, he's inside my house.
They charged me and went back to me with my kids here.
All right, so you're fired a warning fire or did you actually hit him, sir?
No, I hit him.
I never went to get an EMS on the way, okay, sir.
Yeah, I'm on three, sir.
Yes, sir.
And you shot the person trying to break into your house, correct?
Well, I opened the door to see what he wanted because he kept kicking, trying to kick in my door.
And he opened up my screen door and, like, rushed me.
So I backed up real fast and told him, you don't want to do this, you don't want to do this,
you want to get out of my house.
He came at me
He came at me and I fired by a fire
But I didn't mean to
Because when he rushed me the first time
I don't know where the first shot went
And then he took off his shirt
And charged me again
I told him to go
And I shot him
I had my two kids here
And my wife here
I didn't know what he was doing
It's in here
Are the deputies there?
It's where I'm being
Okay, they can take over.
Thanks, sir.
Okay.
