On Sheridan.
What part of Sheridan though, 10th and Sheridan?
10th and Sheridan.
Was it on the east or west side of Sheridan?
Because that's right the border between Denver and Lakewood.
It happens right there on Sheridan.
Yeah, but do you know what side it was on?
I was going up, I was going up, what is it?
Were you going northbound?
Yeah, I was going northbound.
Okay, if you were going northbound, it has to be here in Denver,
so we need you to be inside of Denver so we can set an officer out.
Well, this is the...
Because 29th in Harlan is in Lakewood,
but we need you to be in Denver so we can send an officer out.

I need you to come back into Denver so we can take a report.
Where? Where do you want to come with you?
I mean, you can come over as long as you're on the east side of Sheridan at Denver,
because Sheridan divides Lakewood in Denver.
Man, I'm in shock right now because I got hit with a bottle.

It's outside of Denver's jurisdiction.
Why did it go to Denver when I was calling Lakewood?
It happened in Denver, right?
You said you were northbound on Sheridan?
Yeah.
Yeah, so that's Denver.
So what happened in Denver, we need to have a Denver officer go out there.
Okay.
Okay, but I need you to come into Denver to take a report because they can't go outside
of Denver.
You're in Lakewood right now.
Okay.
