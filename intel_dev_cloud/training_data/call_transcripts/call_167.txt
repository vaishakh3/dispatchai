9-1-1. Where is your emergency?
Good Enough Avenue. Someone is running around the neighborhood shooting a gun.
Okay. They're on foot or in a car?
I don't know. I'm back in my house. I can't tell. I think they're running on foot.
Okay.
I'm at 2393 Good Enough Avenue.
Okay.
But they're on the floor, you guys.
Do you know if it's a male or a female? Did you see you have any description?
I don't know. My husband went outside. I'm in the house with my kids. Let me look at the window.
Okay. I say don't put yourself in any danger. They are en route. Okay. What's your name?
