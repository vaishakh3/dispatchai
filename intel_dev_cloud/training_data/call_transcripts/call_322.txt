Any information that he made at inside the school at all?

No, he's not just told that our shooter is down.
I'm going to be confirmed that.

Have we found any other victims anywhere else other than the kids, the 12-year-old and the two that are down?
I believe we have two students and a teacher and a shooter.
Thank you.
