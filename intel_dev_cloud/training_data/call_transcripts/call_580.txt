Okay, and what's the problem?
Tell me exactly what happens.
Our snake, we have a Burmese python, and she's about 12 foot long.
She got out of the cage last night and got into the baby's crib and straggled her to death.
I'm going to kill the bitch.
Stay on the line, please.
Okay, I do have help on the way there for you, sir, I need to ask you a few more questions, okay?
