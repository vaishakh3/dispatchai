Hi. Can you hold for just a second? I just saw somebody run into the Compass Bank on Thomas and 234th Avenue with a mask on.
24th or 24th?
34th. We don't know who he's robbing it or not, but we're sitting across the street.
And if he comes out and jumps in his car and takes off like a bad out of the hell, I'll do his license plate and give it to you.
And it may be a false alarm. I don't know yet.
Okay, sir. I'm going to get somebody started on anyways.
What kind of vehicle do they come in?
Looks like a white, four-door, Zion, and Mitsubishi thing.
And you said 34th Avenue and Thomas?
Yeah, it's a compass bank.

We could be wrong.
