A-34, go.
No one rates, suspect.
driving a black, newer-model Nissan Central less seen.
Deborah, pre-ence, the suspect vehicle was going to be a newer model
Nissan Center, black-and-color Eastbound University.
Is it a San Diego PD?
Is it one of our officers?
Affirm, same firm.
8-23-Sim. I need medics make it to 45th in University.

Again, we have a, the suspect field was described as a newer black model Nissan Central,

I got two of you. 860, go ahead.
One of the units come up 45th from Whiteman and block it off for us.
Somebody block off 45th in Whiteman and 823, Sam, your traffic?
I got medic 17997 17 temper
20% just for all of his safety but they saw witnesses statements at the scene
that black Nissan that's involved the passenger was a shooter
it was stopped at 45th U, passenger reached out with a gun and fired on
that was Eastbound University right
hey firm as best we have right now is black Nissan two passengers we're getting for the description now
okay
25th block it up there 514 Victor go ahead
Yeah, somebody's units go in 97.
We need some alley control.
We need some alleys controlled at 3,800 highlands south of you.
And then we need one to designate at 4,000 Highland, North...
Highland in the East Alley.
We'll get covered in a minute.
Okay, again...
Some units take some crime tape up here to 45th Street.
Okay.
We have some crime tape to 45th Street.
The suspect view is going to be a black Nissan with two occupants.
The passenger was the shooter.
He reached out and fired at the officer and rolled eastbound on University.
Again, it's a black, newer model Nissan is all we have so far.
The 99 suspect vehicle.
And just we stand.
Just be clear.
Everybody's laid there.
I got a medic 17 on the scene.
I need the box here.
With the ambulance.
619109?
19-10-0.
542-5.
Do you have traffic?
I'll call the deck with the officer's info.
Thank you.
23 Sam, for officer safety, weapon's going to be is a shotgun.
Tiverr, for you and it's monitoring, the weapon's going to be a shotgun.
Able Base, I have pertinent information regarding that.
Headable.
Sheriff just got done chasing a vehicle, Wanderford 245 out of 1541 North Magnolia in Santee.
A weapon was a shotgun.
We think...
It's a black male.
The vehicle was a black Nissan with white paper plates, so if we can put that out,
that sounds like it's the same vehicle.
I had just aired that right before it came in.
Some info on that?
Apply 14. Go ahead.
Yeah, when I was rolling up 97, there was a black flight for similar to a Nissan with paper.
Are we going to check 42 and you for a vehicle, see if it's there?
14 yellow, 42 and you, I'll check it.
Okay, somebody's checking that one.
29.30, 43, did you have traffic?
Maybe you're on to check.
Okay.
860 Sam.
860 Sam.
10-4-CP is going to be 4,400 University in front of the car wash.
4,400 you if you don't have an assignment and get the car wash 4,400 University.
6.14 can you clarify at 40?
I'm sorry, there's still a bunch of units.
Who wants clarification? The female officer goal?
42 in you. They said there was a possible match of the vehicle.
42 in you, there was a possible vehicle that somebody saw on the way there.
The CP is going to be 44 in you.
39 out of Medic 12 and engine 17.
Medic 12, engine 17, 10.4.
14,0, 42, and you check negative.
Check negative.
There's no car there, or the car that's there is negative.
There are a couple of close possibles, nothing exact, and none of them matched.
Again, for instance, the suspect vehicle is going to be a black Nissan.
It had white paper plates, two occupants, possibly two black males from the ESSO's incident.
The weapon in this 1199 is going to be a shotgun.
The vehicle's last thing going eastbound on University from 45th.
Section L-O-7, Victor, it's going to be a black Audi for L-Code PD that just did a pursuit on them.
Affirm on that.
It said an Audi, not in Nissan.
23, Sam.
You got Medi-12 in Route to Mercy.
Can you have some Western units to meet that unit over there at the ammo?
Trevor, anybody from Western monitoring?
Western Unit.
Yes, please. Western Union to Mercy.
I'll go over there.
619, do we have any more intersections at the
Samuanyan who needs block off?
823-Samany. Anybody else need to be...
860 Sam. Have one of use on the far perimeter. Follow medics, please.
Somebody follow medics and then 614 yellow is going to go to Mercy
and meet up with them there.
635 Zee will be following medics.
635 Zuber 10-4.
24-Sam do you have a Samuant en route to Mercy yet?
Is there a Samuinen in route to Mercy yet?
Mercy also?
Not there now.
630 Sam, we'll go to Mercy.
Fine, he's always had up there, right?
6.30, Sam and 124 Sam both in Route to Mercy.
6.0.
14, we're just on the zombie officer in the medical cell.
Merce, 636-0.
Just for units and people searching all the way from 70th long, you checks negative for the
vehicle.
Diversity is checking completely negative for the suspect vehicle, which is either a Nissan
or an Audi.
The incident that the SO put out, they said that it was an Audi,
Can somebody confirm on that?
Elkhone unit 303.
I was pursuing this vehicle to about 30 seconds prior to the incident.
It is an Audi, four-door, approximately five years old.
Yes, or El-Con.
For you know, it's not a Nissan.
It's going to be an Audi, most likely, if it's a vehicle that Elkhazone was pursuing.
It's a four or five-year-old black Audi blackmail driver.
The passenger in the vehicle is the one that,
was the shooter, and he was armed with a shotgun.
And, unfortunately, the good for the death is all the medic and officers, so we don't need that air.
Yeah, I'm not going to air it.
Thanks.
The CP is set up in the car wash at 4,400 University.
If you have a witness or anybody with info, I'm all separated, and make it over to the large whiteboard truck, I'm assuming it's up the CP.
800, Charles, I'm going to route to Mercy unless they need me at the seat.
860, same copy.
Captain's going to the hospital, that's good.
Able Bay, C.S.P. Needs-O-the-Last-known direction or travel the vehicles they have it.
We had with eastbound on University. So far, it's checking negative.
They're on to 70th.

514-Victor is subscribed, 10-4.

The suspect vehicle, again, and this for anybody monitoring,
is going to be that black Audi.
It's about four or five years old.
It was a 245 suspect vehicle in El Cajon.
They were in pursuit of it.
Excuse me, I think that was SDSO in pursuit of it.
It was lasting going eastbound university from 45th with two male occupants.
The driver, at least, was a black male,
and the passenger was the shooter.
He was armed with a shotgun.
Flighter, can you stand where they could?

And 23, Sam, can you just confirm that the best vehicle information that we've had so well has gone out Cowdy and C.HC.W.
Definitely. I have numerous agencies on this frequency responding to this incident, and it has been aired.
The officer that was pursuing it, apparently, is in the debriefing, or debriefing, so when he's available, we'll try to get some more on the vehicle.
23, Sam, I'm tenful on that.
I actually have him here, which you went up his video from the original pursuit.
Thank you.
Temper.
You see any, Sam, you were asking for it, if we need more sergeants?
Yes, it was.
Right now, we've got enough right.

Therefore, I want to go back to that someone advise if they want the meeting announcement.

Okay, I had an anonymous RP, so I doubt we're going to get anything further from them.
What they gave was a T-shirt and black jeans.
They said that the vehicle is parked in front of the building,
407-4 on 48th Street.
Abel, there is a...
There might be a vehicle in a driveway there.
Let's see if a unit can come and take a look at him.
It might be a few minutes out. They're meeting up at the CP there 44th and you abel if you could just stay over that residence.

Watch your crossfire vehicle teased into a building one male armed with a shotgun.
For officer safety, I need one unit to go to the target address and, uh, and, uh, and

Well, let's block off the street at Polk in 48th and, uh, 48th in university.
Do we have this guy in custody, Abel, do you know?

Black pickup truck.
Stop right behind.
that black pickup truck. He was backing up at high speed in that alley, just use caution going
around him. White pickup there, it might be on 60 go.
As far as Able can tell, that we have an outstanding suspect here.
Able, I saw that occupant get in that black outy with the shotgun. It would be a good
idea that go former permit around the target address of 4074.
Okay, but you only saw the one guy.
Okay, as the unit starts it up there, it'll be the West Alley of 48.
The perimeter is the West Alley of 48th Street.
That's the West Alley of 4,048 Street, Polk to University to check the residents.
We've got one outstandee.
Welcome to Thursday.
We're on Estrada 4027 with a pop...
60 Sam, do we know from the... where is the RP that called this in?
And then did Abel see which apartment he was contacting?
RP was anonymous. No idea where or who that was. It was a female only.
Abel?
Well, I only saw the...
Blackmail wearing a white shirt and I don't know if it's dark pants or shorts.
Come out of that apartment complex.
Put the shotgun on the driver's side of the Lincoln.
A.10, Lincoln.
They're going to feed this this complex in the alley.
Who put out that the suspect was down and what is the exact location of the suspect?
Sam.

All the officers I have with me are shooters. I need that.
Oh, I think, two officers.
340-0-97. Where is he wanted?
Uh, 40-43-ish on the 48th Street.
97 and a second.
Eighty-four.
19 yellow, I'm there. I'll be with, I'll stay with the suspect.
19 yellow and 284 yellow will be with the suspect.
810, Lincoln, confirm the location of that suspect.
4043.48th Street.
Well, two things. I still think we need to evaluate a scene that we have to clear.
860, Sam, are you guys formulating a plan to, uh, two things?
check out the apartment or?
813, Sam, fire is asking if
medics are clear in at the scene on 48?
Affirmative, clear man, please.
Forty-point-off.
And 44?
Have them come in off of folk. There's no way they're going to get
unused off of you.
We're bringing up medics in off a pulp, please, 813, Sam.
60, Sam, do we have a phone number
for the RP on that desk call?
A-21 yellow is with the RP,

Able copy?
104.
820 Lincoln.
20 Lincoln?
20 Lincoln?
Can 18 Lincoln advise?
We have 830 in Rue.
Where do you like him to go?
10, Lincoln.
We are in front of 407, excuse me, 4082-48.
48.
Can we confirm with Abel, exactly which apartment they saw this passenger go into?
Anya what apartment number was?
I only saw the driver get into the suspect vehicle.
I did not see the passenger.
It wouldn't be a bad idea to clear that apartment complex to look for the passenger.
Okay.
810, Lincoln, the call came from 407-448 Street.
The plate that 821 gave me shows registered at 407-448 number W.
In that case, then let's just hold a perimeter right now and let's call it a SWAT incident and have them come.
We're not going to make entry on that considering this.
So we're going to be holding the perimeter.
We're going to be doing the code 10 for 4074 on 48th Street.
Lincoln 3.
People advise if the person down, is that the one that they saw with a shotgun or is that the one inside the apartment?
860 Sam, I have some info for you.
Go ahead, 860.
Table confirming that the guy that's down is the guy that you saw, correct?
I can't see the guy that's down.
The person I saw is the same vehicle drive, but the same person or a suspect.
21 Sam, or Red.
8.513 Sam, go ahead.
513 Sam, go ahead.
Yeah, what medics they need to get in?
Can they cross over southbound on 48th Street from Holt?
If it's safe to do so, I see officers with her gun down.
Ken, Lincoln, any deer?
Go ahead, 18 Lincoln.
Dobbs is going to be coordinating the scene here holding the perimeter.
871, Sam Whedon, is going to be coordinating a SWAT response, and we'll be giving a C.
Tempor.
Again, somebody needs to give a safe route for medics to get to the 11-8.
Can somebody do that?
G.S.30, Sam.
I'm going to send two CHP officers up to 48th in University, and they can walk up.
And they also want the weapon's secured, right?
His shotgun?
The weapon is secured, and he is secured.
Suspect and weapon both secured.
Thank you.
7-71.
71.
Code 11, stating the location will be Polk and Australia.
And, um, can Able tell up this perimeter?
Is that pretty good?
First and Sam, if anything may be widened out the perimeter,
and I just want to let the guys know the alley, the west alley, the house.
Okay, 771, any place to avoid for the code 11?
Okay, 10-4, so all the units on the air, they can just hold the perimeter.
The target location would be 4074 apartment number 7.
7771 Sam
Okay
71 Sam
The target location is 4074
Apartment number 7
To avoid for the
7
913 go ahead
I have a fire engine
is locked in
They're trying to get to the down
suspect
I was told a couple
CHP officers
We're going to go get medics
And guide them through
71 Sam
Can you make sure the page goes out
Code 11 ASAP please
Okay
One commander by any chance of you're monitoring
And also 771 any place to avoid
for that code 11.
No, just in front of the target location, they can come from the north or south.
822 yellow myself and three or four other units will be clearing the east side of 48th for...
822 yellow temper.
I can able point out perimeter positions we need a bill.
Able standby one.
If anything, you guys are a little bit too close on the north side off of Polk.
It's three apartments, three buildings south of Polk on the west curb.
That's how close you guys are.
if it turns ugly.
I think that the building on 48th, it's going to be three buildings south of Polk
and it'll be on the west curb line.
There is someone.
Okay, there's somebody with a pink shirt at the target location at apartment number 7.
You know, somebody, just one I'm going to do this, foot 11.
Okay, for all units, all frequencies,
we're going to have a code 11 ASAP for Estrella and Polk.

They said it faces south. Does that answer that question?
No, it faces south, but we don't.

There's sniper one.

No response on that.
And what's the staging area for the Code 11 I heard where the CPS is?
The area is Australia in Polk.
The location they're going to go to is on 48th Street.
And 44th in University is the original CP.
So where would command like E&T to respond to, please?
Probably 44th and you, but Lincoln 3, can you advise?
No, sorry, he's got a question.
Where do you want E&T to the CP there at 44th and you?
810, Lincoln.
We'd like E&T to be on Estrella, south of Polk.
They need to be in somewhat close proximity to the SWATVAM, but not right on top of them.
Service is EMEG-10-4, and the van's 10-4.
Through 3, I've identified the vehicle with the same one that I pursued.
Okay, able-copy, alcohol unit confirmed.

Hey, Sam, losing the incident to the commander.
