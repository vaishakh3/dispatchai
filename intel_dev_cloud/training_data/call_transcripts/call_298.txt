Hi, County 911. What's the address for your emergency?
It's our hunting cabin. It's on the handhandle road across from the pump stations, the Rock Road. I think it's 157.
Okay.
And when we went to the Quails Unlimited dinner last night,
and a friend of mine here looks like he hit his head in the bathroom,
and I can't get him to get up.
Okay.
Is he breathing?
I can't tell.
It looks like maybe, but I can't get his mouth open.
Okay.
Is it the Michael Cook resident?
Yes, ma'am.
Okay.
Does 335151.157th Avenue sound right?
That sounds correct, yes.
Okay.
Your going to...
His nose was...
It looks like it's bleeding like maybe he would slip while he was going to the bathroom or something.
Okay, and he's been there since last night?
Yes.
Okay, what's the phone number you're calling me from?
It's 734.
Okay, I need you to get right down by his face and tell me if he's breathing.
Put your face right next to his nose and mouth.
Okay, it doesn't feel like he is.
Okay, how old is he?
He's 49.
But his body doesn't feel ice cold, though.
Okay.
What color is he?
He's white.
Okay.
This one, he often cold.
He is cold?
Yes, but he's been sleeping on the floor.
Okay.
And you don't feel any breathing?
I don't feel any breathing, no.
Okay.
Where is he at in the bathroom?
Are you able to get him on his back?
I don't think so.
Yeah, good guy.
Okay.
We're going to have to try to do CPR, so I need you to try to get him on his back, if it all possible.
Don't get on your back?
He doesn't think so.
He just found him on the bathroom floor.
He's been there since last night.
He thinks he's so and hit his head.
He's got blood in his nose.
It's the Michael Cook resident.
You got him on his back?
Joe, Joe, come on. Get up.
Is he breathing, or...
Joe, wake up, please.
Go on your back, Joe.
Joe's on your back. Can you hear me?
Joe, can you hear me?
Sir?
Sir?
Can you hear me?
Hello?
Sir?
Hello?
Is he breathing?
I can't tell him.
He is.
Okay.
Were you able to get him on his bag?
No, he's huge.
I can't...
Okay.
Can you...
Can you...
Were you able to get his mouth open at all?
Yeah, he can get his mouth open a little bit?
Okay.
Can you see if there's any food or vomit in his mouth?
I don't see any.
Okay.
Is there anybody else there that can help you move him?
No.
Okay.
You said he's not cold, right?
He's...
His hands are cold.
His stomach's nice cold.
His hands are cold, but not like the rest of his body?
No.
He thinks he's going to be okay?
We really need to try to get him on his back so we can check him for proper breathing.
Can you feel anything if you put like your hand by it?
He'll be on your back.
Does he respond to you when you talk to him?
49
I can't get him on his back
Okay, can you put your
Are you for sure if he's breathing or not?
I'm not for sure, uh-uh.
Okay
I've got my finger in his mouth
Are you able to
Feel in his mouth for anything?
All right
If I got to dispatch
Bring a medical doctor
See if there's anything in there
Blockin his airway at all?
Is there what in there?
Are you able to,
to get your hand in his mouth to see if there's anything in his throat?
Can you hear me?
No.
Are people coming now?
Yes, we got him on their way, but I need you to work with me until they get there, okay?
Okay.
Are you able to get your hand in his mouth at all to see if there's anything blocking his airway or anything in his throat?
His teeth are closed?
Yeah, is that bad?
Okay.
I love him like a brother.
Okay. It's all right. Can you see into his mouth at all even with his teeth close?
There's real blood coming up from his nose, though.
Help's already on the way, okay?
Okay. Stay on the phone.
Okay.
Can you get a blanket or anything?
Yeah.
Try to keep him warm.
Okay.
Looks like you might have fallen in the living room.
there's some broken glass on there.
Okay.
It looks like maybe he was stumbling around in the kitchen a little bit.
Are you back in the bathroom with him?
No, I'm just getting him like it.
Okay.
Okay. There's no way at all you could drag him out by his feet or anything.
I don't think he's a big guy.
There's absolutely nothing you can do to maneuver him around or drag him out at all.
I've been trying.
Okay.
Just anything that you, even if you have to set the phone down,
just anything that you can think of to try to get him out of there
or to get him on his back.
Okay.

It's kind of wedged on the side.

Is it bad?
Okay.

Can you use the blanket to try to help you in any way to pull him out?
