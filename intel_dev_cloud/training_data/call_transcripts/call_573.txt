Yeah, no problem.
What apartment are you in?

Apartment 3?
And I am unarmed.
What do you do with the gun?
I have it here, but I am not holding it.
I separated the ammo from the gun.
Sure.
Who were you in there with?
Well, my roommate, but she left, well, she had brought some people that I didn't know over,
and she started acting crazy, and they attacked my girlfriend, and I told them to leave,
and they didn't leave, and then they told me to leave, and I told them I live here, and they
had some sort of disturbance with these guys?
Yeah, they don't live here.
I've never seen them before my life.
And they were getting a...
So I went in the spare room, and I got the gun.
I said, okay, look, I have a gun to leave.
I'll call the police.
And they said, they're going to call the police.
I said, call the police, please.
You know, I'll call the police.
And then the guy ran at me.
And I thought I remember he ran like bullcharts me.
Sure.
And I was armed.
Like, is he stupid?
I mean, I don't, I don't just, what happens?
No, no, no, no, I agree.
So you said the gun's unloaded.
It's, I mean, I don't, I'm just tripping because I want
No, I totally understand.
I'm going to get police over to help you, okay?
Please.
Where do you got the gun now, Perry?
It's tucked away.
In your bedroom or where?
I just don't want to say it out loud because I don't know who's listening.
Really, I just get sucked away, and it's nowhere near my...
Can you just tell me, because I don't want the officers to get upset
because if they mention gun, they're going to protect themselves,
and I want to make sure that they know where the gun is.
All right.
It's not...
You can whisper it to me if you need to.
I just buy the plant.
Outside?
No, inside.
I brought it inside, so that I knows who is outside.
And it's inside a pot holder.
Do you hear that?
You there?
Yeah, I'm still here, Perry.
All right.
How long this is going to take?
Because, I mean, I heard some irons, and I was hoping they were coming.
Okay, I'm going to talk directly to the cops on the radio, okay?
All right, Perry, I'm just going to talk to the officers, okay?
Okay.
Gary?
Perry?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Can you hear me?
Yeah.
Okay, what's going on?
Hello?
Hello?
Yeah, I'm with you, Perry.
Okay, what's going on?
I hear voices, I hope that's them, it's good.
Perry, I'm just talking with the officers, okay?
Okay.
