It looks like it's been broke or something because it's showing a white light back there. All right. We're coming up on. I guess it's Marinsville Road would be to the right. Or Marisville Road to the left. We'll come on that.

And he's actually hitting the brakes,
so I can't get a bloodshot and Andy's so sweet.

The gate, I guess, Yates Trucking Company.
Trucking Company.
He's coming up on Apple.
Oh, 734.
Yeah, it's right here at intersection 734.

He's slowing down and moving up and we've got a big blind spot here coming up.
And I can't see him because of the medium.
We're coming up, we'll be up on dismisses and get around the curb.
He's going to pick up speed again.

everything in the media. We're here at AlphaVis Motors now.
They're at AlphaVis the motors. Yes, ma'am. He still comes. He keeps flowing down
and switching lanes. He's switching lanes back and forth and forth in the same
mound that he's in. Yeah. Now he's pick up feet again. We drop down to 35 and now he's
picking his feet up again. But it's a dark color. I can't tell. It's a dark gray, dark blue,
a dark black and I can't get a tag because of the way we're situated.
We're at Perkins restaurant.
They're at Perkins now.
Yes, and I'm going to lose me because we're going to get on that stretch down here
without the Vista and I'm not going to be able to be able to see him or not.

He took off.
Oh, God.
I don't want to go this fast.
I'm at 75 now.
He's flying.
Don't put yourself in danger.
I'm not.

On the bridge, out of river bridge.
What that is on the river?
I'm going to remember.
And we're still going.
I see the cops on top, the bridge.
They need to come down.
He sees them.
He's hit his brake.
I'm going to wait closing.
He didn't see the cops.
I see the cop on the bridge.
He needs to come down.
He said the policeman needs to come down.
She said, yeah, he comes down.
Because he's still running in the other line.
and I'm flagging my license traffic here.
Okay.
The cop sitting on the bridge.
He needs to come on down.
He's still running.
We're coming on each bridge where the cop here he comes.
I see the cop coming now.
Go digital still traveling?
He's still traveling, yes ma'am.
South and northbound lane.
Yep, and he's almost come to a stop.
I think he didn't realize where it's dumb jump.
He said.
I'm trying to try to take that exit right here and turn around.
Okay, where's it at now?
He's in the...
I hear sirens in her сами.
I just said.
Do you know he's got blue light in the back of his car?
He just flashed blue lights in the back of his car.
He's taking the exit.
Tell him he's taking the exit or he's turned around.
Okay.
That's right.
Yes, ma'am.
He's taking that first alphabet to exit.
He had blue lights in the back of his wind shield.
He's taken the first out of that exit right there.
He sure he is.
Road come around.
Get turned around.
They're turning around.
I see them now.
He took that first exit.
But he had blue flashing lights in back at his car, like he was a state trooper.
You know how they had his blister back?
All right, thanks all they got to go get in.
Come on, turn around the exit here.
They turned around.
Are we seeing it now?
I have to see it now.
I have to have the cops are more close to him than I am.
So the police aren't behind him?
Yes, well, I don't know how close there.
He took that first exit, and I don't know where he went, because we're all turning around here.
They're going up on across the bridge somewhere.
They're trying to catch you because they're going towards town now.
Yeah.
They've gone up and taken a left across the bridge like they're going back into where the
they took a right on the exit and they took a left and went back across the bridge.
The holiday end, the holiday compil here is the, I can't think it's a way, I guess it's 712 or whatever you go back towards.
