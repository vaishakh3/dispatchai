9-1 location emergency?
Huh?
911 location of your emergency.
1880 Springview.
1880 Springview?
Yes.
The telephone number of your calling from, ma'am?
And what's the problem?
So exactly what happened?
Well, we just found the body, a body of a baby, my grandson.
You just found your grandson?
Yes, he's dead.
Okay, I'm showing you call from 1852 Spring Drive.
Is that where you're at?
Oh, well, yeah, 1852, yeah.
I'm just served right now.
Okay, do you know what happened, ma'am?
Sir, I don't know.
He's been missing for three weeks, my son said, so I don't know.
She's the last one that was here with him, so the Ghana cops already knew that
somebody would have been calling him about him being missing.
So my son came over, something won't feel them right with me, so I told my son to just come over and check the apartment out, and he did, and he found him.
My partner's going to get the ambulance on the way over there, if we have to have to do that and check him out.
Do you think the baby's beyond any help, ma'am?
Huh?
Do you think the baby's beyond any help?
Sir, the baby's been dead for about three weeks or longer.
Oh, Lord.
Is there anything we can do for a call site?
We'll be on the way, ma'am.
Okay, thanks.
Thank you.
