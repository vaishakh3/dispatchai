Just to let you know, that part is suicidal.
He told me to shoot him behind him right between the eyes.
so he's not going to go down without a fight.
And does he still have another weapon?
I don't know.
I disarmed one of them off of him.
It looks like a high standard 22 and then he pulled a revolver on.
Okay, you got a closing description on him?
I think multi-colored.
He's wearing glasses.
He's a white male, maybe 55 or something.
Is that a multicolored top?
This is my information in regards to the party in regards to the shooting.
There's a follow now.
So the suspects of the white male sentenced 50, mid-50s,
who's layering some type of multicolored top.
He also has glasses on.
He was suicidal by police.
He's possibly still armed with a weapon at 15, 18 hours.

No more cars over here.
We got it under the same.
They can put out that bulletin.
So he didn't leave in the vehicle.
It was a Red Oldsmobile?
Yes.

You need to pull up for service.
They have enough cars at this time.
And the suspect apparently didn't leave in the vehicle.
It's a Red Osomobile.
It's a white male in this 50s.
It's possibly armed a gun.
He's suicidal at 1519.

If we've got canine being called out, put out a tone.
I don't want any officers going through the woods.
Leave the scene clear for canine.
Any information on canine's been called out from its residents
and we don't need any officers in the woods at this time.
Fortinine here, we have a license at all.
See you, Tan.
Okay, be advised. The suspect is still in the Maroon Oldsville. He is not on foot. The car has not been located. It's not a machine.
Okay, so we don't need a perimeter then?
Unless somebody finds the car in that apartment complex, we're assuming he's still in the car.
Is it a two-door or a four-door?
Of course.
Can we get the tag on it again, please?

Yeah, we're trying to do a big call.
