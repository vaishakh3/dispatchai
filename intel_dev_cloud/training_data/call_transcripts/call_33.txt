Okay.
Do you want a voicemail?
Well, yes, but I got another question before you put me to her.
Is, um, this is lease towing, South Haven.
Okay.
Taking in a private property removal that's basically in your jurisdiction.
It's not within the city of South Haven.
Uh-huh.
I'm supposed to report this to a police agency, am I not?
That's what we keep reading that we're supposed to report that we have the car in custody.
And I don't know how we're slipping through the cracks about various things, but somehow the car has to be run to see if it comes up stole and all that for it.
911.
I'm sitting here at the corner of Michigan and Hayden Street in Pawpaw.
And a semi-truck just came by and he does not know it, but he has a gentleman on the front of his truck that is in a wheelchair.
And he's pushing him down the road.
And there's a girl on a bike screaming running after him trying to get the trucks to stop.
Okay.
You're Michigan and Hazer?
Yes.
Yes, and they are headed west on Hazen.
I think it was a Ralph Moyle truck.
Westbound on Heathen.
No, westbound on Michigan.
On Michigan, yeah.
Okay.
It's a Ralph Moyle truck, I believe, so I'm pretty sure it was a white semi-truck.
I heard the girl screaming, so I was looking at her when I was getting ready to turn,
and then looked at the truck, and I saw it.
the guy in his wheelchair and he's being pushed by the semi-trog.
Okay.
So she's screaming and then I looked at the truck and went, it's a white truck.
Okay. We'll get them out there.
All right.
See you.
Bye.
