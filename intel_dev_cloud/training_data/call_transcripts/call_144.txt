Thank you your dangerous girlfriend.
911.
Hey, uh, my friend is having a seizure.
Where are you at?
I'm not sure what the address is. I don't live here.
She was feeding her blood.
She's sitting there a little bit.
You think she's what?
I think she's coming through a little bit.
Okay, and how old is she?
Uh, I think she's 20.
Is that her yelling at the background?
Is that her yelling at the background?
Yeah.
Okay, what is she yelling about?
No, that's not her. That's a different person.
What's wrong with the other person?
The same thing that's gone through, they took some kind of drug.
They took some kind of pill?
Okay.
So it's a drug overdose, possibly?
I don't know.
I think it's some kind of a loose engine.
Okay.
So you've got two people having problems?
Yeah.
Yeah, he won't stop yelling.
I've been trying to get him to calm down.
So you've got a male and a female?
Yeah.
Okay, I can hear him.
Are they going up?
Yeah, I think he just knows a little bit.
Daisy.
Is she responsive?
No.
Okay.
She's breathing.
She's breathing, but she's non-responsive?
Yeah.
Okay.
I'm going to let you go,
because I'm going to have to get a deputy to go off there, too.
Okay.
Anything else happens? You call me back, okay?
Okay.
All right, thank you.
911 address to the emergency.
Yes, I just called a few minutes ago.
Yes.
My friend who's had another seizure.
Okay, the female?
Yeah.
Okay.
I do have an ambulance and some deputies en route to your location.
Is she still breathing?
Yeah.
Okay, is blood still coming out of her mouth?
Every now and then just a little bit.
Just a little drop like maybe she's hitting her cheek or something?
Yeah, and she's really hot.
She's burning up.
She's really hot?
Yeah, she's burning up.
Okay.
Okay, I'll update the ambulance that's coming in.
What about the mail subject?
Is he still yelling?
Yeah, he's kind of rolling around on the floor now, yelling.
Okay.
