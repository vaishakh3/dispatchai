Well, we're building the tower.
We were jumping to get ready to back another section.
Okay.
I'm the operator.

The gen pole was going up high, and then the next thing I know, it's coming to the ground.
Okay.
I don't know.
We're not sure what happened.
Okay.
I understand.
Everything is going as normal.
A piece of our rigging is still up on the top of the tower.
We're guessing that something at the bottom of that piece of rigging broke.
Okay.
It's important that nobody touched that rig.
No.
I don't want anybody to touch anything there, okay?
No, nobody's doing.
Okay.
Are you all doing okay?
