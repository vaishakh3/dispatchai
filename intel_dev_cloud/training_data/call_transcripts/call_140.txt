Tell me how this accident happened.
I understand a pole was swinging around and knocked them from the tower?
Well, we're building the tower.
We were jumping to get ready to back another section.
Okay.
I'm the operator.
Okay.
The gen pole was going up high, and then the next thing I know, it's coming to the ground.
Okay.
I don't know.
We're not sure what happened.
Okay.
I understand.
Everything is going as normal.
A piece of our rigging is still up on the top of the tower.
We're guessing that something at the bottom of that piece of rigging broke.
Okay.
It's important that nobody touched that rig.
No.
I don't want anybody to touch anything there, okay?
No, nobody's doing.
Okay.
Are you all doing okay?

Okay.
All right.

I need somebody to be watching the road.
Can we see you from the road or are you back in the trees?
We're out here.
We're out here by the road now.
All right.
Is somebody standing there?
Yeah.

We'll buy what the driveway is.
I'll follow where they're coming from.
They're just, they're trying to get through some traffic and just,
