County Dispatch 911, can I help you?
Water here.
Hello?
Hello, I'm floating down the river in my car.
Okay, what road were you on?
I came up off of, oh God, off of 42, going up cedar-set road, what is it?
I don't know the name of the road.
Where were you coming from?
42, heading south.
Out of Lebanon?
Okay, you were on 42 coming out of Leavenon or out of Waynesville?
Yeah, I came out of Waynesville and I set it up like made a left-hand turn coming into cedar, I don't know, the water's flowing in there fast.
Okay, did you turn on to Waymville Road like you were going down to the trailer park?
Right, right.
Okay, how far down that road did you go?
I'm where it says Little Miami Cedar, the water is coming in here fast to my knees.
Are you down by the covered bridge?
I just don't know what.
What color is your car?
Gray, silver.
A Honda.
Good grief.
I've got help on the way to you.
You said you're in a silver Honda, right?
Yes.
Oh, mercy.
Can you swim?
Not really.
I got a leg that's kind of immobile with the brace on it.
Okay.
Yes, there's a female in that vehicle.
She can't swim.
She's got a brace on a leg.
