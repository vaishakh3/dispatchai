Do you want to see you transfer medical?
Call what address do you need help?
This is an emergency road hike on Lake Malacca hike and my kids are in a smoke
and it's not awesome.
Ma'am, ma'am, I need to come down so I can figure out where I'm at
when my partner starts help.
Where exactly are you?
Lake Malacca.
I still call me south.
It's the Lake Malacca hike.
Okay.
Where did you access it from?
We accessed it.
It's probably Gany Creek.
It's, um, I think it's a Gany Creek Trailhead.
Okay.
Oh, I don't do you.
I don't know.
I'm, ma'am.
Sam, listen.
I need to calm down so we can get in there, car.
I'm going to need a helicopter.
Ma'am, listen to me.
Okay.
How far up from the Jenny Creek Trailhead are?
We're at, we're at the first falls.
There's the falls there.
Okay.
How far do you think you've hiked in?
I think two miles in.
I think two miles in it.
About two miles?
Yes.
Please, hurry.
And how long did this collapse on them?
It just collapsed like three minutes ago.
Okay.
Please, hurry.
Come on.
Oh, my God.
You have such a chance.
Okay.
You need to.
You talking to me is only going to help them, okay?
Okay.
How many kids are trapped?
My 17-year-old son and a 14-year-old neighbor boy.
Okay.
Okay.
And it's an embankment.
it came down?
It's a big snow cave by the lops.
Okay.
It's a big bunch of snow in between.
Okay.
Please.
There's somebody coming.
Listen.
You're doing a great job, okay?
But we need to get some help, okay?
How far in...
I can't do it too mild.
I don't have an apple to me.
Listen, listen to me.
How far into the cave were they?
Maybe 100 feet into the cave.
Okay.
Okay.
And how many feet deep do you think it is?
Can you tell from where you're looking at?
I know.
I can't.
Are you standing somebody?
You're going to go.
Are you scared somebody?
Listen to me.
My partner has already started help.
That's what I told you at the beginning of the call.
So you happened to me if I were getting all a help headed that way.
What is your name?
Joanie Corbett.
J-O- and I C-R-B-E-T-T.
Okay.
Okay. And is there anybody else with you that can head back down the trail to direct the cruise in when they get there?
There's a gentleman here who's trying to help us, and then my neighbor, who's the mother of the other boy, and I think she's too upset to make it down.
Okay. Can you hear them? If they yell to you, can you hear something. Can you hear because of the fault. Can you hear them? Are they yelling?
I don't hear anything. No, we don't hear anything. They have their cell phone, so I don't know if it should see us.
Okay, what I need you guys to do is stay as calm as you can.
In case they can hear you, we need you guys to stay calm so it doesn't excite them at all, okay?
Okay.
What you guys need to do is just tell them help has already been started.
They need to stay as calm as they can so they can conserve their air while they're in there, okay?
Okay.
Okay.
And did you guys...
Oh, God, you've got to worry.
I'm not kidding.
I can't come down.
I know.
I know.
You're doing the right thing. My partner has already started help, okay?
What does that mean? Are they hiking in? They're not going to make it if they're hiking in.
No, listen to me. I'm just fucking help. My partner started help as soon as I figured out where you were.
And you said it was Lake Malacca?
Lake Malacca. Do you know how probably in our kids and got to smell sale and our kids in there?
Almost two miles in is somebody coming.
Yes, yes.
Can't come. I'm sorry.
You need to say, okay.
No, I want to hang up.
No, please don't hang up with me because I need to get them information while they are in
route to you, okay?
I am in a dispatcher that has already started the cruise to come to you.
Okay.
I need to call my husband.
Does somebody have a cell phone?
No.
Okay.
Joni.
I need to call my husband.
Joanie, go ahead and put somebody else on the phone so that you can call your husband.
I need to talk to somebody else.
Okay.
Hi, this is 9-1-1.
Who am I speaking with?
Well, it's Chrissy.
It's other mom.
Okay.
You're the other mom?
Yes.
Okay.
And how old is your son?
We're 14 and the 17-year-old.
Okay.
I mean, and it's a big ice thing.
It just fell right on.
We heard the sound.
Okay.
So it's an ice cave or a snow cave?
It's like a snow cave.
You know, it hasn't melted yet.
Okay.
Okay.
And just so you know, my partner only started
and how by, as soon as I figured out where you guys were, okay?
Yes, we're by the waterfall.
I don't know if it has a name.
Let me ask somebody.
Okay.
Does this waterfall have a name?
You guys don't know.
Okay.
Okay.
Go ahead, please.
How deep do you think it was?
Um, you know, the ice came up.
It was just a huge block.
It's double.
We waved a 10.
I don't know.
Okay.
And it's a seat of ice that came down?
Yeah.
Okay.
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my gosh.
Okay, I know. And what was your name?
My name is Chrissy.
Okay.
Chrissy, like I told Joni, my partner started from help as soon as you guys call us, okay?
Okay, I appreciate that.
I just want to keep you guys on the phone so I make sure they have all the information that I can get from you.
Yes, I know.
How?
It's like an overhang thing that comes over and there's water running underneath, and it sounds like it just came, you know, like slam right on top of them.
I don't know.
I can't hear them.
There's too much noise of all the water running.
So I can't hear anything.
Okay.
So there's a lady that came.
Are you guys from another organization?
We're from our youth group.
Oh, you're from our youth group?
Oh, okay.
There's a leader here, there's a woman that's up here all the time.
She's gone in there.
Just that's the situation.
Okay.
I want to make sure that if anybody else goes in there, though,
that I don't want anybody else to actually go towards the cave
because I don't want it to collapse on anybody else.
Okay.
That's what I told them.
I think, I don't know if they're, you guys, just don't go inside.
We're friends going to, you know, be sorry about it.
No, nobody else goes in there.
No, nobody else is going in there.
They're trying to go around it, you know, on the side of it.
Yeah, oh, that's my phone.
Okay, so it sounds like part of the inside of the cave.
This is a lady still.
We just have to talk to the lady.
He has to stay on their phone.
It's pretty good.
It's great.
You know, too.
Okay, Johnny, I'm sorry, Chrissy.
Okay, I'm sorry about that.
So it sounds like they got the collapse is partway into the cave, is that kind of?
Yeah, it collapsed partly into the cage.
Can you get a hold of Ryan?
How far deep into the cave was it before it collapsed?
How deep is it collapsed?
I would say it's probably maybe 20 yards across and, you know, 20 by 20.
Okay, so the cave is 20 by 20?
Yeah, so 20 by 20.
Okay.
How far deep was the collapse in it, though?
I mean, was it 50 feet into it or?
No, no, no.
It's probably 10 yards into the, or seven yards into the, where they walked in.
Okay.
You're doing great.
We're doing what we can to get everybody to you.
It's called search and rescue as well as we've got the fire department started also, okay.
Okay.
Can you confirm, do you know the phone number, Jonnie's phone number by chance?
I don't know, Jenny.
I can give you her phone number.
off of my phone. Hold on up. This is a second.
You're her cell number? You're her cell phone number?
Hello.
Is it Joni?
Yes.
Is somebody coming?
Yes. What is your phone number, Johnny?
It's 2006.
Uh, 372.
Okay.
3776.
Okay. Go ahead and get your phone back to Chrissy, okay.
Just do what you can to say calm.
Okay, Chrissy.
Let's talk to it again.
Brian.
Okay.
Okay, so anyway, we're at the waterfall.
Okay, I'm going to talk to Brian.
Hold on, I'm going to talk to Brian.
Okay, Brian, so we're at this, like, this ice kid at the top of the falls,
and Alex is all, you want to go in, and so they go to wait about seven yards
and then, you know, just exploring, and then we heard this bowl,
and then we go, see, surprise.
So we have somebody here that, let me go, we're at that, um, Malacca.
that you gave us direct for and we're at the top of the falls.
So we're at the top of the calls, right.
Okay, open people are calling home.
We can't hear anything.
Oh, the water is calling down.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
This is Joni again.
Okay, Joni.
Are you okay?
I mean, I know you're, I know you're upset,
but I just want to make sure that you're okay right now.
I am.
And if anybody else right there with you guys in there
injured.
I'm sorry.
What you said?
Is there anybody else?
It's with you guys right now, not in the cave, but outside is injured.
Nobody else is there.
No, there's some people that, no, nobody else.
There's some people that came along.
There's like three people that are in there trying to rescue them now.
If we can, I want to make sure, though, that whoever is in the cave is safe.
I don't want it to pass to anybody else, okay?
No.
Well, this one woman that went in, I guess, is up here hiking all the time,
and I guess she really knows what to do.
Yeah.
We don't know that the cave is stable.
Does that make sense?
Yeah.
If they've already collapsed once.
So I can't say that you're in person being in their time.
Oh, my God.
Okay.
Can you worry get something with this?
Helicopter coming or something?
My partner has already started to help for us.
We have search and rescue that's been started,
as well as in a fire apartment.
We have everybody that we can coming out to help you guys, okay?
Okay.
But I want to make sure those other people aren't going to get trapped as well.
Okay.
Well, they, I,
I don't know.
I'm afraid to go in.
I've got my seven-year-old daughter here,
and they seem to know what they're doing.
They went right in, and she just said, oh, I can, I know what I'm doing.
Okay.
So I was able to yell to them to see if they can hear or see anything further?
There's one guy that can hear.
Okay, let's find out if people in there can hear or see anything further.
They're all outside on top of it now, and I don't know how smart that is.
I don't want anybody on top of it.
if it's if it's
