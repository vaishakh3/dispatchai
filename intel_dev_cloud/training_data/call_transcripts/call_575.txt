Number one.
Listen to me.
Calm down and I'll tell you what you do, okay?
How old is she?
Okay, and you said she's having a seizure?
Okay, okay, calm down.
Okay, take a deep breath.
Take a deep breath.
I'm going to get an ambulance over there, but I need you to calm down, okay?
The first thing, listen, the first thing you need to do is make sure that there's nothing around your mom that's going to hurt her.
Like, clear the area, so when she's having a seizure, she doesn't hurt herself, okay?
Okay, don't put anything in her mouth.
Don't try to hold her down.
Just let her have a seizure.
She's going to be just fine, okay?
Okay.
Once she stops shaking, I need you to check her breathing for me, okay?
She did.
They're checking her breathing?
Yes.
Is she coming out of it?
I don't know.
She's not breathing.
Okay.
Does anybody there know CPR?
Yes.
Who knows CPR?
Who can I talk to you to give CPR instructions to?
No one knows.
My dad's not home.
Okay.
Okay, what I need you to do is listen to me, listen to me, and I'll tell you what to do, okay?
Turn her flat on her back.
Okay, she is.
Okay, go ahead and kneel down by her side.
You said she's not breathing, right?
Yes.
Okay, kneel by her side.
Okay, I am.
Pinch her nose.
Okay.
And with your other hand, yeah, pinch the nose closed, and with your other hand, lift the chin up, so the head bends backwards?
Yes.
Okay, and then completely cover her mouth with your mouth and give her two big breaths, okay?
Okay.
Is that her making noise?
Yes.
Is she trying to breathe on her own?
Yes.
Is there anything in her throat, like vomit or a phlegm or anything?
She's not throwing up?
No.
Is that air getting into her lungs?
Is like her chest going up and down?
Did the chest rise?
Yes, yes.
Yes, it did?
Okay.
What I need you to do is she moving and coughing or breathing normally yet?
Oh, no, she's starting to breathe normal.
Okay, then what I need to do is go ahead and roll her over onto her side.
Just on the one side, okay?
One sec.
And stay with her.
And just...
Mom.
He gave her two breaths, and I could hear gurgling.
I can't get her on her side.
Can you turn her head over so she doesn't throw off in her mouth?
I'm trying.
Okay.
She's not, is she waking up?
Mom.
She's moaning.
She's not.
Yes, she's on the bed.
Okay.
And just tell her, just tell her the ambulance is on the way.
Just reassure her that helps on the way.
Okay.
Stay with her and I'll stay on the phone, okay?
Okay.
Has she ever had this seizure before?
No, not yet.
No?
What happened?
What were you doing right before it happened?
Oh, just out front.
You were just out front?
Yes.
And did she allergic to anything, like a bee sting or did she hit her head recently?
Yes, she hit her head.
When?
Today?
No, it's her sick last.
You should have a brain injury.
She has a brain injury?
Yes.
Okay.
Okay, well, we're going to help her, and we'll be there in just a minute.
