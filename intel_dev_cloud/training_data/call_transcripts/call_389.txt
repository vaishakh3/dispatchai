It's 770, 833-0-740.
Did you get an Annie Alley on that?

Jones Bridge, that's...
Yeah, that's north.
No, that's...
It came in.
on the non-emergency line, and she needed City of Atlanta, but they wouldn't pick up, so I, you know, processed the call. But she could barely speak to me.
We can't find it. What kind of?
She gave me a 6.02 Wells Drive.
Oh, there's no 602 Wells Drive.
I got a Wells Street.
That's what I thought it was, and she could.
corrected me. Now, when I look in the system, I see a Wells drive southwest cross
street of Willisneill Road. Yeah, but that's 1,600 block. Oh, okay. Actually, that's the
1,800 block. Okay, well, and I went with Wells Street at first, but, um, well, if they're doing,
it's just hitting off the bridge. She said St. Andrews. I have two cars. Can you hold?
Sure. I guarantee it's in Sandy Springs.
Yeah

Well, it may be the number. It may be it. The 770833-0740.
Oh, this is running off Jones Bridge.
But that's the address. He gave me 602 Wells Drive.
Oh, man. I'm hoping it ain't up there, but I'm thinking it might be.
It may be.
Um, I wonder who's got that territory.
That's rural Metro, isn't it?
Mm-hmm.
Sandy Springs?
Yeah.
Because I don't seek a Wells Drive.
Drive off of Jones Bridge for St. Andrew's apartment.
Okay, and then this one there's St. Andrews.
I mean, I looked up the apartment complex itself and it's got an address of...
Yeah, I see it.
The 10055 Jones Bridge?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm guarantee you again.
It's going to be up.
there.

We can't find nothing.
Okay.
So you want me to send up there?
Yes, if you can.
Let me see.
All right.
Okay.
Okay.
I will look again to make sure, but I think that's where it's going to be.
And that was a cell phone you got, right?
Yeah.
Yeah, I can't do a reverse trace on that.
Okay.
Well, I'm going to send it to that address, apartment 602.
Okay.
Okay.
Thank you.

That's all I got.
The lady went unconscious on the phone.
I couldn't even get a name.
Hello.
Ready?
Yes, ma'am.

Do you guys have a cross street or something?
We can't seem to locate this person.
Okay.
Now, we're sending north.
We're going to send north to Jones Bridge Road.
There's a St. Andrew's Department of North, so
real metro isn't right there.
So it's not on us?
I don't believe it's going to be a Grady call.
We're listening to the apartments that she said.
St. Andrew's apartments?
Right.
That's where we're sending.
And it's up north you said?
Yes.
And her cell phone came from up north address, so we'll be trying that.
So it's going to rural metro?
Yes.
All right.
Thank you.
All right.
All right.
