No, an emergency, what are you reporting?
Hi, I'm reporting an airplane crash at SFO.
An airplane crash at SFO?
Yeah, we were hiking on a trail outside of Pacifica,
and we just heard a giant explosion,
and we're with a couple other hikers,
and they saw that an airplane had crashed right there at SFO.
Actually, at the airport?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
What's your name?
My name is Jared Foster.
All right, Jared, hang on the line.
and I'll transfer me over to the police department at SFO, okay?
Okay, thank you.
911 emergency, what are you reporting?
Hi, C.H.
There was an airplane crash at SFO.
Okay, we did get the call.
Okay, you did?
Yes, we did.
We still see any sirens or anything.
We are responding.
Trust me.
Thank you, sir.
Bye-bye.
Now on the original reporting.
Hi, we just, we're at the San Francisco airport and our airplane just crashed upon landing.
And I think we need some here.
I'm not here as soon as possible.
Okay, what runway yet?
What's that?
Are you in a specific runway?
I don't know the runway.
Italy just ran out of the airplane.
What kind of airplane were you in?
Aegean airline.
Asian?
Asiana.
Okay.
There's a bunch of fire trucks and a couple of ambulances.
There's one or two, but there's a lot of people hurting on the ground,
and we probably need people.
My name is Sang Duong.
Okay, and you don't know what runway you're in?
I do not know the runway we're on. I see FFP, but I'm looking around trying to see something, but I don't really see anything else.
Okay, where are you at on the runway?
In the field.
You're in a field?
Yeah, we're in the middle of the runway. I can see the main station, but I really don't know much more.
Sorry, I'm not familiar with this airport.
Okay.
All right, down the line up here. Let me get you over there. Don't disconnect.
Yeah, I see tons of cops and ambulances coming now, but, uh...
Hold on.
Hold on.
...with the transfer of a crash landing at the airport.
I got one of the passengers on the line.
Go ahead.
Sir?
Hi, uh, yeah, we just, uh, handed on the airline and, uh, it looks like the sun's up coming, but not too many ambulances.
Yes, no, we do have the ambulances in the fire department on the way. Um, okay.
Can you tell me, are there people that are trapped on the plane? I know some people have gotten off already.
I got, I think the majority of people got off. I tried to stay back, but I think there are at least a handful people behind me before everyone was telling us to get out.
So, maybe...
Are you guys actually trapped or it's just that people haven't gone down?
No, no. Most people are going down to slide, and I think there's some people going into the plane now.
Why are the people going back into the plane?
The emergency crews.
Oh, I'm misunderstood. Okay. But the passengers are all slowly getting off the slide?
I think the majority, maybe 99%. I don't know if anyone's still in there, but the majority of people are out of the airplane.
Okay. And again, I'm sorry. I don't know. I just want to make sure that I understand.
It's not that they're trapped.
haven't gotten off.
They're not trapped, exactly.
I think almost everyone is out.
I don't think anyone is true.
Unless someone got hurt in there and they're trying to get them out or something like that.
Okay.
Do you know about how many passengers are still on board?
When I was leaving, there's only a handful.
So I'm assuming that almost everyone got out.
I see all the stewardesses and the crew members are sliding down now.
Okay.
What kind of a plane is that?
I know that they're already there, but...
Asianic plane.
Let me just pull out my boarding test.
It's okay if you don't have that.
I mean, are you a big place where you are, first of all?
Yeah, we're out.
We're way past the field.
Like, everyone's at least 100 yards out.
I see an area that says Monitor 120.5.
What are you looking at?
I see a sign that says Monitor 120.5.
Uh-huh.
And that's pretty much old.
I see, I could do FSP, but a couple of instruction trucks.
No, that's okay.
I was wondering what kind of an aircraft that was.
I don't know.
Now I'm running.
