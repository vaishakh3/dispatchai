911, where's your emergency?
There's a guy that just tried to get out of his car.
He got out of his car, and he tried to in my truck.
He's driving a Jeep Cherokee or Jeep that's red in his license site number is YRF 481-2.
And he's going west on Patton Avenue.
And when I was stopped at the light at East Esther.
West on Patton from where?
at the light from New Leasdester Highway?
Yes.
And I was in the bus lane,
and now he just circled around,
and he's behind me now.
I'm really freaked out,
and I'm scared to stop,
and I have a self-light.
So you're at Leicester and Patton now?
I'm on Patton,
and I'm just passing
Severeview Road.
Dever v.
He was right behind me.
And he tried to get into your car, is that what you're saying?
Yeah, he tried to pull me out of the truck, and now he is all up behind me.
Why do he try to pull you out of the truck, man?
Because he cut me off, and I honked at him, and when we got to the light, he jumped out and came to my truck.
What is your name?
Julie. Sorry, Julie Brown.
What is your phone number?
What's the guy look like that's in the truck?
Big. He's got a goatey, dark hair with gray in it.
I should have paid more attention and I was freaked out.
Is he white?
Is he a white male?
Yes, he's a white male.
There's three other people in the car with him.
So you cut him off and he got mad and come up and tried to get in your car.
I'm sorry?
You cut him off, he got mad, and he come up to your car and tried to open your door.
Yeah.
What kind of vehicle are you in?
I'm in a Ford F-150 pick-up.
What color is it?
Silver.
You said it's a red Jeep Cherokee?
I don't know if it's a Cherokee.
All I know is it's a red Jeep.
that the license plate I gave you, I read it off the back, but now he's behind me, so.
I'm going to follow me all the way home.
If there, like, a police station that I can drive to, I don't want this person following me home.
Boy, you can drive downtown to the police station, ma'am.
I'm, like, way away from campus.
You're not that far away if you're on Pat in there.
I'm almost to exit 44.
You're almost to exit 44.
What road are you on now?
It's still patent or what is it, 1923 that it turns into?
Okay, it splits off several ways there, to 240, to downtown or to 1923.
So I need to know which way you split off and went.
I'm on 1923.
It's Patton Avenue.
It just goes straight out.
I don't know what else to call it.
I didn't get on the freeway.
I'm on the regular road.
Okay, so you're still just on Patent Avenue.
You could go to 970 Haywood Road.
There's a substation there.
970 Haywood Road.
Yes.
That's where the library is.
Fire station on Haywood Road.
I know where there is one up in Inka in front of me.
I think.
You know where the fire station is there anyway?
An Inka in front of you.
No, he's right behind me still.
I'm saying that I think there's a fire station up ahead in front of me.
It's the Inca fire station or whatever they call it.
I'm not sure what the name of it is, man.
Huh?
I'm not sure what the name of it is.
Otherwise, you can go to a public place, a restaurant or something, and stop where there's other people.
Yeah, well, he's definitely following me.
Okay.
Like I said, you have the option getting off and going to somewhere.
I could feed for my bumper.
He's going to hit me.
My God.
I understand what you're saying.
So you can either keep driving or you can get off somewhere that's where there's a lot of people.
Can you not get in a different lane and let him pass you or pull off somewhere?
I'm glad that he won't.
Okay.
Can you pull off somewhere where it's very public where there's a lot of people?
Yeah.
If I can get past this light, I will.
What lighter are you at now?
Um, it's Old Haywood Road.
Old Headwood and Patton?
Yes.
Oh, I am scared to tip.
You need to tell me if you get off.
I got over and now.
He's getting up his side.
Yeah, he's got his family in there, looks like.
They're at Patton and Haywood right now.
Just tell me if you pull off the road, man.
I'm pulling off at the Shoney's McDonald's right after the exit.
Sure, exit 44.
Just pull off at the Shoney's and Patton, now.
Exit 44.
He is still in the other lane, so I don't, he can't get off.
He's trying, but he can't.
He got stuck in traffic.
Oh, no, God, he whipped around somebody.
Oh, my God.
Where is he going?
Oh, my God.
He just stopped in the middle of road.
He's coming back.
He's coming back.
What am I supposed to do?
Ma'am, I told you, you can get off and go somewhere very public
where there's a lot of people to witness anything that would happen.
I'm sitting in this parking lot.
It's very public, so everybody can see me get killed.
Ma'am, are you in the parking lot at Shoney's?
Is that where you are?
Yes.
Stay in the car, keep your doors locked.
We've got an officer en route to you.
And stay on the phone with us until the officer gets there.
We can just let us know what you see him doing.
Do we have his vehicle description?
He turned down and he's turned around and he's coming back.
Stay in your vehicle, ma'am.
Keep your doors on.
The van's coming back to Shonings, who has.
Whoever's dispatcher?
Does she know this person?
He drove right by.
No, he's turning at the next flight.
He's coming around the back way.
Did he pass Shoney's and go away from you?
I'm sorry, what?
You said he turned around at the Holiday Inn and came back.
Did he get back on the highway or he stay on Patton?
He got back on the Patton and it looks like he's going to
back the way we just came.
Okay.
You just stay there.
We've still got two officers in route.
I want you to talk to them, okay?
Okay.
Thank you.
Okay.
Just stay on the phone with me until I get there.
That's fine.
Just stay there until the officers get there.
Stay on the phone with me.
You got her vehicle description of you?
Yes.
Thank you so much.
Sorry, my name.
Excuse me.
Ma'am.
Yes.
Do you still see him?
No, after he drove past, I haven't seen.
He sees him back down.
Okay.
Okay.
He couldn't find me in the parking lot.
Okay.
Did you know this guy at all?
No, not at all.
I was in three leans deep at that intersection and I was pulling up to the light and he just moved over.
and I had to lock them up
and I honked my horn at him
and as soon as I did that
he just threw a drive-side door
but he came out of me
I locked my door
So it's kind of like Red Ridge
Yeah, I guess, yeah.
Okay
The family's in there
I just can't believe
that he just followed me all the way out here
Okay, it's okay right now
He's gone
So don't get upset again, all right?
Huh? I'm sorry
I said don't talk yourself into getting upset
He's gone now
If you could just stay calm
to the officer gets there
Yeah, I'm like trying to stop shaking now.
Right.
No, she needs to meet with the officer at Shoney.
She's waiting.
She's going on.
Thanks.
She's almost there to you, okay?
I'm off and bonds.
If you see him, can you kind of flag him down?
I mean, he'll be looking for your vehicle, but it might be easier if you see him.
Yeah, I'd just like pulled in between trucks, so he wouldn't see me now.
Today works the last time I ever honked my home.
Yeah, you have to be careful.
There's all kinds of people out there.
He just kind of endorsed it over, and I, I mean, I'm not.
You know, so it's just automatic.
Well, it is, and you have to let him know that you're there,
sometimes get his attention that way,
but just don't, you know, continue to follow each other when it happened.
Oh, God, no, I didn't follow him at all.
He just was in front of me, and then he looked around behind me
and kept driving up on me and stuff.
Right.
When he jumped out, I locked my door.
I was like, what do you do?
Yeah.
And then he followed me all the way out here.
God.
Click on the maps if you can see where he is.
There they are.
Okay.
You got his attention?
Are you okay to hang up with me now?
Okay.
Are you okay to hang up with me now?
Yes.
Thank you so much.
You're welcome.
Thank you.
Uh-huh.
Bye.
