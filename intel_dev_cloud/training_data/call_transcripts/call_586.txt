Hi, my name is Leah Vanderholt.
I'm calling here from Parkesburg.
I may you've already had calls about this, but there's been a shooting here.
Yes, we've got help on the way.
People are being sent.
Okay.
Thank you.
Yes, they are.
Yeah.
Are you with the stuff?
I'm right across the street from here in the Schneiderman home.
We can see the building right now.
And all we see is the police.
blazer. We don't see any ambulances. We don't see anything.
The ambulance is on the way right now. They had a hard time getting a crew, but they are on
the way. We also have paramedics that have been en route for about 10 minutes.
Oh, okay, and we're just keeping every kid that was there to witness that he's in this house
right here. Okay, what's the address of that house, Leah?
What's the address of this house?
507 North Johnson. All right. Keep them all there, and as soon as we can, it could be a little
bit, but we will have the officer stop there, all right?
Good. Thank you. Thank you. Bye.
