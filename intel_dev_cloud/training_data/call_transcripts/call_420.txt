Okay.
What's going on there?
We just came into my sister's house, and she's on the floor.
There's a girl's in there.
She's, okay, she's on the floor.
The girl's in there.
Okay, ma'am, ma'am, listen to me.
Listen to me.

Is she awake?
No.
Okay, is she breathing?
What?
Ma'am.
I'm sorry, what?
Is she breathing?
No.
I'm giving her a bond to the gutty who went into the room.
Okay, there's another man there.
Hi.
Okay, so can you tell me what's going on, please?
Yeah, we went to check on her sister.
My brother and her had just separated.
He moved out today.
Okay.
We went to check on her.
Her door was locked.
No lights on.
I opened up the bedroom door.
I, Jimmy, pushed open the lock,
to unlock the bedroom door.
She's on the floor.
There's a spent bullet casing next to her.
Three two kids are in the bed.
And it looks like there's a gunshot wound on one of the kids on the side.
Okay.
So we have three patients total?
Three, yeah.
Okay.
Are any of them breathing?
No, they're all.
They're all dead.
They've been dead for a while.
They're blue.
They're cold.
Okay.
Listen, sir.
Sir?
In fact, actually, the other one has a gunshot wound in her as well.
Okay.
Sir, I need to listen to me very carefully.
Can you see the gun?
No, I do not see the...
Okay, I do not want you to try to find the gun.
I need you to back out of the room.
I'm mad now.
Okay, perfect.
I do not want you to touch anything else.
Nothing else.
All right, I want you to go...
I pressed the door.
I checked her pulse and that was it.
Okay.
You're sure that they are all deceased?
Yes, I checked the pulse as they're just...
Okay.
They told me to get out.
They told me to get out.
She has got to stay away from them.
Okay?
Please tell her to stay away from them.
I know she wants to go in, but she has to stay out of the room.
Come on, Mom.
Al.
Come on.
Okay, who is all in the house with you?
You and your, is that your wife?
No, that was my mom.
Okay, I need them all to stay out of that room.
They're out.
Okay, what's your name, sir?
My name's Justin, Johnson.
Justin, Johnson, what's your phone number?
Listen, Justin, I actually want you to get all of the people out of that house.
They are.
We're on the porch.
So there's nobody else in the house but the three patients, correct?
Yes.
Okay.
All right, Justin, I want you to stay there.
Officer should be arriving any minute.
Do not go back inside the house, okay?
Heather, Heather, stay there.
Okay, get Heather in the truck.
Okay, we'll be there.
Okay, Justin, thank you very much.
Thank you.
All right, bye-bye.
Bye.
