I've combined it.
No, he's...
Yes, sir, this is...
And I called to all at 24, somebody to come out here.
Please, because he'd been called...
Is this Norman Avenue and O-M-A-M-A-N?
Oh, he can be Tennessee.
What's the name of the street again, ma'am?
Okay, hold on.
On second for me, let me find it, okay?
Yes, sir.
I'm going to be about my son.
I don't have no family yet or God.
Okay, is this Sheila Jones?
Yes, sir.
Well, Ms. Jones, we have your call.
We haven't dispatched on it yet.
Y'all haven't dispatched on it.
No, ma'am.
What, what do you mean you haven't dispatched?
You're not going to come out and nobody's coming out here?
Yes, ma'am.
As soon as the sergeant gets an officer,
by the boyably, he doesn't send somebody out there.
I mean, I've been sick.
Jago, if he kill me, he keeps on calling somebody, he's going to kill me.
I mean, I mean, why don't tell him what he did, I mean, he would have come and he'd kill me.
He's dead with somebody going to say, what was him dead?
He's never told me if I don't kill me.
He was two people that I called.
And he would inject me up right in front of the cable man.
The cable man was in my house.
So it ain't like I'm making this shit off.
And he said he called me something, I better not cut my side, watch my bag, I think he hit my window.
I don't know what's going on.
But when do y'all want him to kill me so he can put yellow paper around this and say,
we got there just for the devil?
Is that it?
I don't understand it.
I don't understand that.
I don't understand that.
I'm scared to leave off my fucking house.
Okay, ma'am.
I'll take that too much as soon as possible.
I really just don't give a shit what happens, yeah
