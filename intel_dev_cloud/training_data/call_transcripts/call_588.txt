911, where is your emergency?
No, somebody just came in and shot my daughter and my husband.
They shot them?
Please, and what's your...
What's your...
And what's your...
And they shot your husband and your daughter?
Are they out conscious?
Please, ma'am, please.
She's bleeding out of her.
Oh, please.
How old is your daughter?
She's 10.
10.
And where were they shot?
In the head.
In the head.
Should I pick her up?
No, no.
I want you to leave her where she is.
Okay, what I'm going to do?
Are they still there?
The people who are there?
They're coming back in.
They're coming back in.
Do you know who they are?
Oh, .
Get the f*** out of here.
Get the f*** out of here.
Let me not.
I'm going to do now.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Hello?
Are you still there?
Are you okay?
Ma'am, I don't know.
I'm scared.
Okay, how many people were there?
I don't know, ma'am.
Okay, I was asleep, and I can't even move.
I've been shot myself.
Okay, where were you shot?
I think I'm shot in the leg.
I'm not sure, ma'am.
Okay.
Are you armed?
Yeah.
Okay, they're coming lights and sirens, okay.
They are coming.
Ma'am, please, hurry.
Did you see any of them?
No, I didn't.
I just got up, ma'am.
because they told us that somebody was an escape jail or something.
They want to come in and look at my house, and they just shot my husband, and they shot my daughter,
and they shot me.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, man.
I can't believe this is happening.
Yeah, they are coming, okay.
You said that they told your husband that they wanted to come in because there's an escape person?
Yes.
And that the whole party was surrounded.
I'm sorry that the whole property was surrounded with Border Patrol and everything.
Oh, my leg is killing me, ma'am.
How long is it going to take them to get here?
Okay.
And are they still in the house?
I don't know, ma'am.
I'm just sitting right here bleeding like crazy and I got this gun loaded.
Okay, what kind of gun do you have?
I don't know what it is.
Is it a handgun or is it a rifle?
It's just a handgun.
Okay.
Oh, my God.
I can't believe they killed my family.
Yeah.
Where in the house are you?
I'm in the kitchen.
I hear just staring at the door.
Are you with your husband and your daughter?
No, I don't even want to look at them, yeah.
What kind of vehicles do you have on your property?
I have a suburban in the front, and I have a...
What color is the suburban?
It's black.
It's black.
It's white.
I don't know if they sold it, though.
All I can hear is that they were looking.
for money and they sold other stuff. I don't know. It looked like they were putting stuff in my house or something.
No, and you said there was a white truck or a sedan?
It's a white Ford.
White Ford truck?
Yes.
And did it sound like males were talking?
There was a male and there was a shorter fat woman.
Okay, now the woman, what did she look like?
Was she a Hispanic woman?
No, she was a white.
She was white.
Okay.
And I have one of their guns here that they f***ing left.
Okay, don't touch that.
Okay.
No, no, no, you're fine.
No, no, you're fine, don't worry, it's fine.
Don't worry about your cussing.
Can you remember the clothing that the female was wearing?
They're all dressed in, um, in, um, in, uh, camouflage.
Camel, like, green camouflage?
I couldn't tell, and the guy is, like, super tall.
And the male, was he also white?
Yes.
Okay.
And then a Mexican came in.
So there was a white male, white female, and a Mexican male?
Yes.
And was he tall or was he like average?
No, he was like almost six something.
He was tall also.
They shot me and I pretended like I was dead and my daughter was crying.
So they shot her too.
They shot her again after the first time you told me?
They shot her like two or three times.
Okay, is there anybody else in the house that's your family?
No, I'm by myself.
Okay, so it's just you, your husband and your daughter that went in the house?
Yeah.
Do you have any dogs, anything in the house?
Um, there was a couple of dogs, but I think they went out when the dog's all else in the house.
Okay.
They are coming lights and sirens.
We have units in the area, okay, but I want you to stay on the line with me until
we have someone with you.
We are.
We are coming.
Okay.
We are coming.
I can't believe you.
Ma'am, last Saturday, got in a fight with the girl and they think maybe she has something
to do with it.
Okay.
Now, do you, I mean, was there any, like, drugs mentioned, or are they just looking for money?
What were they, do you know?
I couldn't tell.
They just said hurry up and get what we need, but I mean, we don't have drugs or anything like that in this house.
Do you think maybe it was a mistake?
Or do you and your neighbor have anything?
I don't know.
Okay.
Oh, my God.
I've been so much pain.
Yeah.
And in which leg it was shot?
My right.
My right leg.
Okay.
And it's falling.
Yeah, keep some pressure on it, okay.
I'm just trying to hold it.
What am I going to do?
I don't know, honey.
We'll get somebody out there for you
and they'll help you through this, okay?
And the gun that you said they left behind,
is that a handgun?
Ow, ow, oh, my God.
That gun that they left behind, that's a handgun, right?
It looks like a thought-off shot-gun or something like that.
And you didn't touch it, right?
No, I can't move, ma'am.
Okay, that's good.
Don't touch it.
As soon as I thought they had left, and I think she came back because they forgot the gun and I jumped up too.
Okay.
My husband's always had a gun in the house just in case.
And that's good that you know how to use it.
Did you, did you hit any of them or any of them wounded, you know?
Oh, ma'am.
Was that you shooting that I heard off?
No, he was shooting at me.
He was shooting at you.
And you don't think you hit any of them?
No.
Okay.
Did you shoot off any rounds from your gun?
Yes.
Oh, my God, Mel.
How many shots do you think you shot off?
I don't know, whatever you are.
Okay.
So is that you, only you shooting, or did they shoot, too?
No, they were shooting, too.
Okay.
Oh, my God.
Okay.
And now, did you hear any vehicles to speed off after they left this last time?
I just heard some door shut.
You heard door shut, but that was it.
Okay.
How long is your case?
They should be in the area.
I think what they're doing right now is just checking the area where I'm trying to convince them to get someone to you, okay?
So there should be, there's multiple units.
I mean, they have like the whole army coming towards you, okay.
I need to lay down, ma'am, I'm sorry.
That's fine, lay down, but take the phone with you, okay, keep me on the line.
So you can keep me updated on how you're doing.
Is your daughter still crying?
No, I think she's gone, now.
Okay.
And you're not expecting anybody, right?
I know family members are coming to visit, anything like that.
No, no, it's too darn late for that.
We were sleeping.
Okay.
And does it sound like they have any accents of any kind?
Were they speaking like normal English, like me, you and me?
The two first ones came in, we were speaking English to us,
and we were asking what's going on, and they were trying to
see you don't have the right to ask any questions right now.
We need to check your house for this, this, this, and this.
And my husband's like, why do you have tape on your gun?
And that's why they shot him.
Oh, okay.
Okay.
Did you notice they took anything?
Oh, okay.
No, no, I mean before when they first came in.
No.
Okay.
How are you doing?
Are you holding up okay?
I understand what you went just went through.
I don't mean to ask that in that sense, but is your leg, are you okay?
I'm just going to stay.
Okay.
So the male shot your husband?
Yes.
Was it the white male or the Hispanic male?
They don't know.
So was there another one besides the three subjects that you told me about?
No, hold on now.
There was a lot of them.
But the ones you saw, there was the white, the Hispanic, and the female?
Right now, I don't know.
Okay, I need you to think.
I need you to help just kind of focus on what I'm saying to you
and try and answer the questions.
I know your leg hurts.
I understand that your families were shot,
but I need you to answer these questions
so we can help catch these people, okay?
I just need you to think,
just to keep your mind off of what's going on, okay?
If you had to estimate, how many people would you say?
Four or five.
Four or five, and were they male,
and then that one female?
Yeah.
Okay.
Were they all wearing camel?
camouflage?
I only saw the three.
Okay.
And you're in the kitchen?
Okay.
And you can't think of any one that would want to hurt you or your family?
You don't have any family?
Can you do me a favor?
What's that?
Can you call my mom and dad?
Yeah.
Yeah.
What room is your husband and your daughter in?
They're right here in the kitchen.
They're in the kitchen also.
In the living room.
Okay, you're in the living room now?
No, they're in the living room.
Okay.
So are you, is it like your kitchen and your living room connected?
No.
Okay.
Are they on that way?
Yeah, yeah.
They're in the area.
They're right there.
I'm really afraid that some people are going to come back.
Yeah, they should, I mean, they should be right there because they're asking you where you are
and where your husband and your daughter are, so.
Tell them it's safe to come inside and nobody's in here.
Okay.
Oh, my way, because I didn't know her really bad.
So you heard me yelling at them.
Yeah, I heard a couple shots, and then I heard you yelling saying,
um, you said get out or I'm going to shoot you kind of thing,
and then I heard more shots.
Is there going to be help against me?
No, this is self-defense.
You're going through a traumatic event.
Dude, I wouldn't expect anything unless...
And it's good that you got it on tape.
I mean, everything...
Because you're telling them, you're telling them to get out,
and this was after shots were fired.
And then I don't know if you shot first.
I don't know what happened,
but everything that I could hear is on the recording.
I'm sorry.
taking so long. I'm sure it seems like a lifetime. Can you remember anything about the people
that you saw that would make them stand out? She's really short and fat, and he was really
super tall, and he was a big guy. Okay. Were they wearing any masks, anything? No, his face is painted
black. The white guy? And was he the only one that had the painted face? Okay. Did I know him?
Like the female that you saw, and the other male that you saw, they didn't have black faces?
Okay.
I only saw the lady.
I didn't see the other person that came in.
Okay.
So the female face wasn't painted black?
No.
Could you tell what color hair she had?
Did she have a hat on?
I didn't even tell them.
Okay.
No, I understand.
I'm just asking you questions.
Oh, my God.
I don't believe that he's happening.
And I am so sorry for this.
I don't know if this stuff happens.
Nobody ever has a reason for these things.
I'm like I've never heard of any of this stuff happening in Aerovodka.
Yeah.
Yeah, it's definitely new to me.
I haven't heard of anything like this either.
I wonder if they stole my vehicles outside as well.
Okay.
Okay. And can you tell me the best way to get to your house?
Let me just go down the Skeet Road where the community center has come all the way down.
All the way down to the end, all the way southbound?
I don't know, ma'am. I don't know.
Okay. Is it, are you right there at the corner of . . . . . . . . . . do you have a fence around your property at all?
Oh, yeah. My lights are all on, though.
Okay. So the fence is it just your front yard or the backyard?
No, I see the front.
Okay.
And you're right there on the corner.
There's no other trailers or anything on the property.
I hear somebody pulling up.
Is that down there?
No, that should be then.
Let me double check, though, okay.
Do you see any flashing lights, anything like that?
Hello?
Do you see any flashing lights?
I can't get up.
Okay.
You don't see anything like reflecting off the house or anything.
Okay.
They should announce themselves, like when they're coming in, they should say...
They're pulling out, really so.
They're pulling out, like they're leaving?
Yeah.
All right, can you see what's going on?
Hold on, and you get the gun.
Yeah, you just get the gun.
Are you up? Are you walking?
No.
Are you crawling?
No.
Okay, you're still in the same place you were.
Okay.
Somebody's going to pick off, ma'am.
Is it like gravel on the gravel?
You could hear the gravel?
Uh-oh, I see the dirt.
The dirt, okay.
And you didn't hear any doors open or shut or anything like that?
Are you hearing anything right now?
Okay.
I'm hearing cars driving crazy outside.
Yeah, there's lots of deputies coming here away,
so I'm hoping it's one of them.
Do you hear a lot of movement outside?
Yeah, I hear cars are starting back and forth.
But you can't see outside.
Is it sound like they're speeding?
Yeah.
Okay, we do have units there.
Keep me on the line, okay, until there's someone with you.
You're sure it's them.
I'm sure it's them.
My dispatcher just told me that someone's there now.
And they have Border Patrol with them, okay?
So they should be coming into the house.
They're going to announce, and more than likely they're going to clear the property.
So if you hear people coming in, let me know, okay.
Okay, can you please call my family now?
Yeah, they're going to, I put their name and number in the call, so that's going to get done.
They lock the gate and they can't get in.
I hear I'm trying to open it.
The gate clocked?
Yeah, I don't know.
I don't know if they might have locked the gate when they last and they get harder to get in.
Please come in a hurry.
Put your hands up and put the gun down, okay?
They're yelling.
Put your hands up and put the guns down.
I can't get up.
No, no, you don't have to get up.
I just want, what I want you to do is I want you to put the gun down.
Okay.
Put it away from you.
I'm in here, sir.
I'm in here.
Tom, you can't move.
He's here in the kitchen on 911, sir.
I'm right here and there's a gun.
Is he with you?
Yeah, he's with you.
Okay, I'll let you go.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
