Hi, this is at the Venice airport.

that's going to land on the beach at Venice,
close to the airport.
I'm not sure exactly where he is.
Okay, you said he's going to be landing on the beach?
Yes.
Okay, I've got 101 North Esplanade.
Do you know what Cross Street?

Okay, and just to clarify, you're not certain if it's actually crashed on the beach?
I do not know yet.
He had declared an emergency on the Unicom.
We monitor Unicom here.
He declared an emergency.
I got his N number, but he's not answering me now.
I'm trying to see how many are on board.

Could you use our assistance?
Yes, sir, please.
He declared an emergency, but I haven't gotten any other information.
You know if he was north or south of the field?
No, sir, I do not.
He just said that he was fine.

What's the registration unit?
Yeah, it was 886 Charlie.
Okay, what type of aircraft is involved?
Did a large, small, or military?
Stay to stand by.
I can look it up for you if you want it.
Do you want me to look it for you?
If you can, I'm sure they're going to run them.
And then I see a calm, I look out there all that time.
If you have that aircraft located, we're going to go ahead and continue
upon the border.
Okay.
Okay.
We have the aircraft located just a mile south down the beach of the airport.
Arrow on that side, copy.
Okay.
The tail number on that plane was 8-826 Charlie.
It's a Piper 28181, which is a Piper Archer.
Okay.
So it's a low wing four-seater.
Okay.
If the aircraft on fire, do you know?
No, they did. Nobody said it was on fire.
And they said there's people around it, so you'll probably get another 911 car.
Yeah, it looks like I was trying to see if we have anybody that's with it.
Do you know, is it a single engine?
It is a single engine, yes.
And do we know how much fuel is on board?

It is the sand right at the shoreline.
You hit the water and kind of rolled up on the sand.
People are running down to it.
I'm not quite down yet.
Is it anything out of the plane that you can tell?
I can't tell just yet, but I assume that's going to be people surviving.
It's been looked at that back.
What color is the plane?
I believe it's white-ish.
I'm trying to see it from the distance.
White with a blue stripe, I think.
Was there anybody else near the plane when it crashed?
Were there any bystand standing under it?
Hard to tell is a 200 yards in front of me.
Okay.
So it's going to go over my head, and then I saw it go out.
There's so many people standing around.
There's a guy down on his knees.
What is your name and phone number for our records?
Phone number.
We do have fire units on the way out there as well as law enforcement.
Okay.
If you could, it would just help them, if you could just kind of flag them down and direct them,
just in case they have a hard time locating, which I'm sure they won't.
But if you could just help direct them, they would be great.
They are on their way out there right now.
If you have any further information, call us right back, okay?
Very good. Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
