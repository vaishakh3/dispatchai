I'm up here at Mike Donnell up here.
And I had other like seven burgers.
And I went to my vehicle right, and I came back to him
they took a burger from me.
A burger, like, I'm calling about Donaldson, right?
But I'm just saying, I told them they get me six burgers.
They want to, they want to, they want to, they want to get my burger,
and they want to talk junker, and they're sitting there at Mike Donner.
